Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2.

There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files.

Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4.

Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Our AI-driven technology boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing adjusters to process over 4x the number of claims, enabling them to focus on decision-making and customer service. No more toggling between multiple systems, manually clicking through endless spreadsheets, or struggling with burnout. Agentech’s digital agents instantly handle the tedious work in the background, delivering accurate information to adjusters at key decision points. This allows claim handlers to leverage their expertise for faster claim closures while delivering superior customer experiences. Our carrier partners are already experiencing significant improvements: 4x+ claim output without increasing labor costs Enhanced accuracy and efficiency, reducing manual errors Seamless integration with existing claims workflows While we’ve successfully transformed the pet insurance claims space, Agentech is expanding to support P&C claims processing, with plans to venture into travel, workers\\' comp, gadget, renters, home warranty claims, and more. Our technology takes on the slow, repetitive work—sorting through dense medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents—so adjusters and vet techs can focus on what they do best.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher.

Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\\n\\nUsage:\\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. \\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

brings the total [raised](https://www.securityweek.com/compliance-automation-startup-regscale-scores-20-million-investment/) by the company to more than $50 million, was led by Washington Harbour Partners, with participation from M12, Hitachi Ventures, Ankona Capital, SYN Ventures, and SineWave Ventures.\\\\n\\\\nThe funding will enable [RegScale](https://regscale.com) to grow its go-to-market team and expand the capabilities of its platform.\\\\n\\\\nThe Virginia-based company has developed what it describes as a continuous controls monitoring (CCM) platform that leverages AI agents to continuously monitor compliance, automate evidence collection, conduct audits, and analyze risk.\\\\n\\\\nThe platform is designed to help organizations build compliance programs, continuously monitor various types of risks, and integrate compliance-as-code into DevSecOps processes.\\\\n\\\\n“CISOs are faced with ensuring the systems that keep our country running can withstand increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. From homeland security missions, to the grid, to our leading cloud service providers, to global banking transactions, every compliance gap can quickly become an operational catastrophe or worse, a national security risk,” said Travis Howerton, co-founder and CEO of RegScale.\\\\n\\\\n“RegScale was built to close those gaps in real time while cutting costs and accelerating missions,” Howerton added.\\\\n\\\\n**Related**: [Security Analytics Firm Vega Emerges From Stealth With $65M in Funding](https://www.securityweek.com/security-analytics-firm-vega-emerges-from-stealth-with-65m-in-funding/)\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement.

Normally, the funding would have arrived on October 1, but now, leaders at the state’s 27 public media stations, most of which are located in remote and isolated locales, had only a few weeks to find ways to fill the gap.\\\\n\\\\nStakeholders did what most civic leaders would do when confronted with a time-sensitive and hyper-local crisis —\\xa0they asked their local community foundation to fill the gap and support a coordinated statewide response. Within days, the Alaska Community Foundation (ACF) established the Voices Across Alaska Fund (VAA), a pooled fund that aims to keep every station on the air after October 1 and to develop a longer-term statewide sustainability plan.\\\\n\\\\nACF formally announced the fund [on August 1](https://alaskacf.org/alaska-launches-voices-across-alaska-fund-to-preserve-public-media/). Six weeks later, the Rasmuson Foundation, the largest private funder in Alaska, announced a $1.5 million grant to the VAA. “The fund is designed to do two things,” said President and CEO Gretchen Guess. “Keep stations on the air now and give leaders time to plan for a stronger, sustainable future without federal funding.” On September 14, *Anchorage Daily News*’Iris Samuels reported the fund had [raised $3.5 million](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/).\\\\n\\\\nVAA is drumming up support at a time when local media outlets are scrambling to fill CPB funding gaps with private dollars. Philanthropy is also taking the initiative. Most notably, last month, a group of funders, including the Knight, MacArthur and Ford foundations, committed [$36.5 million in emergency funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media) for at-risk public television and radio stations, focusing on outlets serving rural, Indigenous and other underserved communities.\\\\n\\\\nThe investment comports with these large and nationally focused funders’ long-standing support for [local media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media). But news out of Alaska is a reminder that mega foundations can’t do it alone. Building sustainable local media ecosystems also requires the involvement of community foundations that bring four distinct advantages to the table — deep ties with local outlets, discretionary grantmaking dollars, experience in quickly rolling out [pooled emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-6-30-community-foundation-leaders-talk-rapid-response-and-evolving-roles-during-crisis) and, as of 2023, collective oversight of at least [$54.9 billion](https://www.nptrust.org/reports/daf-report/) sitting in donor-advised funds that can fill federal funding gaps.\\\\n\\\\n“Voices Across Alaska emerged out of urgency, relationships, and trust,” said ACF President and CEO Alexandra McKay in an email to IP. “We had to act quickly so no Alaskan community lost its voice.”\\\\n\\\\n## How the Voices Across Alaska fund came together\\\\n\\\\nFounded in 1995, ACF has a long history of supporting Alaska’s [public media ecosystem](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media) through donor-advised and designated grants to stations, journalism initiatives and community storytelling projects. “Public media has always been one of the ways Alaskans care for each other — our donors have backed stations and storytelling for years, and ACF has often been the platform to make that support simple and effective,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nThe termination of CFB funding presented VAA’s advisors with a challenge that, I suspect, is also confronting stakeholders coordinating emergency response plans elsewhere: How to most effectively provide support for the state’s public media stations, especially when some have been independently raising money since first learning of the CPB cuts on July 17.\\\\n\\\\nAdvisors determined that the fund would adopt a two-step approach to governance and fund distribution to address this question.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each station gets “credit” for the [emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/a-regrantor-deploys-emergency-funding-as-others-wait-and-see-on-trump-cuts) it has raised locally since July 17, measured in months of operating runway. The pooled fund would then bring every station up to the same minimum coverage level, such as three months. If there’s still money available after that time frame, all stations are lifted together to the next milestone, such as six months, and then nine. This model, MacKay said, is “fair, simple and keeps every community’s station on air for the same amount of time.”\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation also approved of VAA’s approach. “It looks out for all the stations, from Unalaska to Utqiagvik to Ketchikan to Homer,” said Guess. “This grant is about meeting the moment with the long view in mind.”\\\\n\\\\nGuess’ perspective suggests that no fund can indefinitely operate on emergency footing, nor can its advisors plan on a future administration reinstituting terminated federal support. As a result, VAA advisors plan to have the state’s outlets pivot to opportunities that lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability once they achieve operational stability. These opportunities “could include [multi-year support](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/explainers/what-is-multiyear-funding), donor matching efforts, policy engagement and continued collaboration on shared services to reduce costs system-wide,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\n## Donor-advised fund support can stem the impacts of federal cuts\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation’s $1.5 million contribution to the VAA builds on its nearly $6 million in total funding for Alaska’s public broadcasting system since 1981. Previous grants helped to support the system’s infrastructure, statewide reporting collaborations and Indigenous programming such as [“Molly of Denali,”](https://pbskids.org/molly/) the first nationally distributed children’s show to feature an Alaska Native as the lead character.\\\\n\\\\nThe foundation joined a mix of individual donors, corporations and national funders that [have committed to the VAA](https://alaskacf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create/fund?funit_id=14239), with some choosing anonymity at this time. (ACF will share names once additional funders authorize public recognition.) “Having Rasmuson’s early support and promotion of Voices Across Alaska was both appreciated and reflected the trusted partnership we’ve built through past rapid-response efforts,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nFour words in McKay’s quote —\\xa0“past rapid-response efforts” —\\xa0speak to community foundations’ unique value proposition at a time when nonprofits are reeling from federal funding cuts\\xa0and bracing [for more reductions](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026) that will further increase demand for services. Community foundations are the first line of defense [whenever a crisis hits,](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2021-8-17-how-community-foundations-across-the-country-are-confronting-the-climate-crisis) which explains why Alaska’s public media leaders reached out to the ACF upon learning that CPB support had evaporated.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, community foundations have direct and indirect access to substantial financial resources. Together with its affiliate foundations, ACF supports donors and nonprofits, distributing over $15 million in grants annually. It also manages over $250 million in assets and administers more than 2,800 funds established by donors. It seems perfectly plausible that VAA can close the remaining gap in terminated federal funding with support from ACF’s [DAF account holders and other donors.](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-3-7-this-fund-is-using-daf-money-to-combat-inequities-in-venture-capital) Indeed, Alaska Public Media President Ed Ulman told *Anchorage Daily News*’ Samuels that since July, new donors [have begun giving](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/), or existing donors have upped their contributions.\\\\n\\\\nCommunity foundations are also using their bully pulpit to push back against cuts. In May, the *Orlando Sentinel* published an op-ed by Central Florida Foundation President and CEO Mark Brewer, titled [“Public Media is a Vital Community Asset.”](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/05/08/commentary-public-media-is-a-vital-community-asset/) “Cutting funding to public media is a profound mistake, with consequences far beyond the loss of popular programming,” Brewer wrote. “It erodes a crucial source of trusted information when the nation and our community struggle with disinformation and division.”\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, in the Twin Cities area, the Minneapolis Foundation will be convening national and local journalism thought leaders for the October 8 “[Minnesota Meeting: Next in News](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/events/minnesota-meeting-next-in-news/),” where they’ll sketch out a roadmap for a sustainable news ecosystem. Last month, the foundation committed $75,000 to Press Forward Minnesota, an affiliate of the [national journalism coalition](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/press-forward-director-dale-anglin-on-generating-funder-support-for-local-news), from its [OneMPLS Fund](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/onempls-fund/), a collective impact fund designed to respond to urgent and emerging local needs.\\\\n\\\\n“Local news fosters community connection, provides essential information and plays a critical role in our democracy by helping people engage in issues that affect their lives,” said Minneapolis Foundation Vice President of Collective Impact and Giving Patrice Relerford in an email to IP. “It’s important for all of us to work together to ensure that our news ecosystems continue to thrive.”\\\\n\\\\n**Related Inside Philanthropy Resources:**\\\\n\\\\n**For Subscribers Only**\\\\n\\\\n* [Journalism Grants](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/fundraising-for-journalism)\\\\n* [Report: Giving for Journalism and Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media)\\\\n* [Civic & Democracy Grants for Nonprofits](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/civic-democracy-grants)\\\\n\\\\n## Funders can be doing more to address federal funding cuts\\\\n\\\\nVAA may not be the largest Trump 2.0-era emergency response fund, nor does it cover [a broad swath of the United States](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/why-the-mellon-foundations-lifeline-for-humanities-councils-is-so-important).\\\\n\\\\nThat said, by providing an exportable roadmap for community foundations looking to help outlets serving remote and underserved areas, it’s a constructive addition to the national philanthropic dialogue. “Because rural stations operate with high fixed costs and extremely small revenue bases, they cannot quickly replace [lost federal funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-are-helping-grantees-withstand-federal-funding-cuts),” McKay said. “If a station goes dark, it is costly — and sometimes impossible — to bring it back.”\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, community foundations already have the muscle memory for rolling out emergency funding. VAA’s governance model builds on this core competency by showing how funding can equitably stabilize a state’s stations before pivoting to activities that ensure the field’s long-term financial sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nThe VAA is also a reminder that the ongoing debate as to whether philanthropy can [“fill the gaps”](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/actually-philanthropy-can-fill-the-gaps-or-at-least-think-much-bigger) in terminated federal funding isn’t a zero-sum proposition.\\\\n\\\\nNo one, to my knowledge, is asking funders sitting on a combined $1.93 trillion —\\xa0that’s [$1.68 trillion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-1-29-foundation-assets-reach-a-record) currently sitting in private foundation coffers and [$254 billion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/three-takeaways-from-a-new-report-providing-a-penetrating-look-at-the-daf-industry) in DAF accounts as of 2023 — to cover [$425 billion](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-trump-continues-block-least-425-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american) in congressionally authorized funding that’s been frozen by the Trump administration. But saying funders can only do so much takes a page from the [scarcity mindset](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2022-8-3-philanthropys-scarcity-mindset-is-hurting-the-sector-not-helping-it) that has unfortunately pervaded the philanthropshere for years, when in reality, the sector has formidable resources to mitigate the impacts of federal cuts.\\\\n\\\\nPhilanthropy’s collective resources — financial and otherwise —\\xa0are bountiful, and community foundations can help build resilient local news ecosystems by acting as a trusted convening partner, allocating discretionary grantmaking dollars and encouraging their DAF holders to support organizations through pooled funds like VAA.\\\\n\\\\n“Alaskans look out for each other,” said ACF’s McKay. “Voices Across Alaska is how we stay connected — working together so every community’s voice continues to be heard.”\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## **Featured**\\\\n\\\\n* ## [How Community Foundations Can Help Local Public Media Withstand Federal Funding Cuts](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-can-help-local-public-media-withstand-federal-funding-cuts)\\\\n* ## [Will Philanthropy Get a Cut of the $3.3 Billion Murdoch Succession Deal?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/will-philanthropy-get-a-cut-of-the-3-3-billion-murdoch-succession-deal)\\\\n* ## [Rapid Response: Funders Pool Their Dollars to Protect Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media)\\\\n* ## [Spreading Love Through Media, the Regrantor Way](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/spreading-love-through-media-the-regrantor-way)\\\\n* ## [After a Hiatus, What’s New with Open Society Foundations’ Distinctive Fellowships?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/after-a-hiatus-whats-new-with-open-society-foundations-distinctive-fellowships)\\\\n* ## [Who’s Funding Public News Media?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media)\\\\n* ## [What Wallis Annenberg’s Passing Could Mean for L.A.’s Legendary Family Foundation](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/what-wallis-annenbergs-passing-could-mean-for-l-a-s-legendary-family-foundation)\\\\n* ## [What Happens When the Feds Target a Nonprofit?

Mandatory Credit: Alonzo Adams-Imagn Images / Alonzo Adams-Imagn Images\\\\n\\\\nIn this story:\\\\n\\\\n* [Oklahoma City Thunder](https://www.si.com/nba/team/oklahoma-city-thunder)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City needed all hands on deck for its magical Finals run. The franchise brought home its first NBA championship after a historic regular season and silenced every doubter along the way.\\\\n\\\\nIt was an organizational effort from top to bottom, but it really was a perfect roster. Oklahoma City was the deepest team in the league and it showed on the brightest stage. Mark Daigneault never wavered from his strategy of playing a deep bench and the effort and energy outlasted other elite teams in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThe bench played a key role in the Thunder’s title run, there’s no doubt about it. But the Thunder also had one of the best — if not the best — starting lineups in the NBA. Oklahoma City’s starting lineup logged an unbelievable plus-14.8 when sharing the floor together. It didn’t matter if Oklahoma City went big with **Isaiah Hartenstein** or small with **Cason Wallace** — it was sheer domination.\\\\n\\\\nAs the Thunder turns its attention to a quest for going back-to-back, there will be a lot of familiar faces up and down the rotation. The starting five should remain unchanged, and the team’s entire lineup is back for another year. The chemistry will only continue to grow.\\\\n\\\\nAs Oklahoma City’s starting lineup was the NBA’s best a season ago, there’s no reason to expect that will change this upcoming season. [Bleacher Report recently graded each team’s starting lineup](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason) after the offseason, and it’s no surprise that the Thunder’s was in the top group.\\\\n\\\\n“OKC\\'s title-winning team is fully intact and should have plenty of trust in the above unit, which offers a double-big look without sacrificing spacing or secondary facilitation,” [Grant Hughes wrote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason). “If anything, (Chet) Holmgren should be expected to improve his shooting, and Hartenstein could easily make further developments as a foul-line passing hub.\\\\n\\\\n“(Lu) Dort and J-Dub are as good as it gets defensively on the wing, and Holmgren is arguably more impactful than either of them as a highly mobile shot-blocker. With SGA running an offense that should be focused on improving its flow, there\\'s no reason to expect these guys to be anything less than the best lineup in the league.”\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City received the highest grade given out at an A, as there were no A+ grades given out across the league. Joining the Thunder at A-status was the New York Knicks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Houston Rockets. Of course, three of those teams are Western Conference foes, and the Thunder faced off against two of them in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThis Thunder team getting even better with another year of chemistry, development, and continuity should be a terrifying thought for the rest of the NBA — but it’s entirely possible. By the time the bench unit comes in, the comfortable lead allows the rest of the rotation to play a free flowing style of basketball and maintain the pace on both ends of the floor.\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City’s starting lineup should only improve with more court time and motivation to back to back.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[ROSS LOVELACE](https://www.si.com/nba/thunder/author/ross-lovelace)\\\\n\\\\nRoss is a 2023 Oklahoma University graduate who has formerly written for the OU Daily and Prep Hoops.

The company aims to enhance geothermal efficiency by using a closed-loop system filled with refrigerant, unlike traditional water-based systems. This approach is expected to be 50% more efficient and reduce water usage. Leading the Series A round are Evok Innovations and other notable investors such as Active Impact Investments and Toyota Ventures. Despite facing competition from established companies like Fervo Energy and XGS Energy, Rodatherm plans to utilize the funding to build a 1.8-megawatt pilot plant in Utah by 2026, with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems set to purchase electricity from the project.\\\\n\\\\n#### Tags:\\\\n\\\\n[closed-loop system](https://www.startupecosystem.ca/news/tag/closed-loop-system/)[Energy

The Wildcats finished second only behind Texas Tech, which made the National Championship Series and came within a game of winning the title.\\\\n\\\\nLeading the way for Arizona was dual threat player Devyn Netz, who posted an ERA of 2.25 (career-high)\\xa0 winning 22 games in 152 ⅓ innings of work to go along with her 118 strikeouts.\\\\n\\\\nNov 28, 2014; Tucson, AZ, USA; Detailed view of an Arizona State Sun Devils sticker over the logo of the Arizona Wildcats during the 88th annual territorial cup at Arizona Stadium.

She was a monster at the plate, batting .347 in 173 at-bats and smacking 19 home runs while driving in 68 RBI on the year.\\\\n\\\\nWith the ability to pitch in the circle and get it done at the plate, Netz won the Big 12 Player of the Year Award and was named to the NFCA second-team All-American list.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Wildcats were able to make the postseason and host a regional as the No. 13 overall seed hosting Ole Miss, Grand Canyon and Santa Clara, the Wildcats were unable to get out of their own regional.\\\\n\\\\nThen, at the end of the season, Arizona and Lowe saw a mass exodus of players enter the transfer portal and leave the program, including most of its pitching staff and star outfielder Dakota Kennedy, joining other teams.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the Wildcats and coach Lowe are trying to get things back on track and are working towards building up the 2027 recruiting class.\\\\n\\\\nRecently, the Wildcats were able to land a four-star recruit in catcher Emma Anderson, who is out of Eaton, Colo. and is listed as the No. 1 player in the state.\\\\n\\\\n“I’m so excited to announce my commitment to the University of Arizona to further my academic and athletic career! Thank you Caitlin Lowe, Lauren Lappin, Amber Freeman and Christian Conrad for blessing me with this opportunity,” said Anderson. “A special thanks to Coach Marty, Coach Dena, and the ENTIRE CA family. To my family, thank you for all the sacrifices you took to get me here. Next stop, Tucson!”\\\\n\\\\nArizona will be trying to not only get back into the postseason but develop talent to make a run to a WCWS appearance.\\\\n\\\\nPlease be sure to share your thoughts on the Wildcats landing four-star catcher Emma Anderson for the 2027 recruiting class.

He has been a mainstay for the last decade, and he decided to leave this offseason for Milwaukee.\\\\n\\\\nTurner won\\'t be the only player who is gone from the lineup. Tyrese Haliburton will miss the entire season after tearing his Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [Pacers Make Change to Home Court to Honor Reggie Miller](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-make-change-to-home-court-to-honor-reggie-miller)\\\\n\\\\nHeading into this season, there will be more spots open in the rotation than there have been in the last couple of years. It\\'s a rotation that still will be formidable, though.\\\\n\\\\n## Figuring out the Pacers\\' rotation without Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton\\\\n\\\\nWith Turner gone, the center spot is up in the air. Right now, Isaiah Jackson has the upper hand in winning the starting center spot. Unfortunately, he\\'s coming off a torn Achilles that he suffered early last season.\\\\n\\\\nIt will be a battle between Jackson and Jay Huff for the starting center minutes. James Wiseman will fight with whoever loses that battle for the backup center minutes. Tony Bradley is likely the odd man out.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [NBA Insider Predicts Tyrese Haliburton’s Olympic Future](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-news-nba-insider-predicts-tyrese-haliburtons-olympic-future)\\\\n\\\\nPascal Siakam and Aaron Nesmith will still be the other starters in the frontcourt. Obi Toppin is the backup power forward again, and he might see some small-ball center minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJarace Walker will likely finally get regular rotation minutes throughout the entire season. He fell out of the rotation in the playoffs, but he played well when he was given the opportunity to see the court.\\\\n\\\\n## The Pacers\\' backcourt has more questions than the frontcourt\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Nembhard slides over to the starting point guard position with Haliburton out. Bennedict Mathurin moves into the starting shooting guard position.\\\\n\\\\nT.J. McConnell is still the backup point guard, but the backup shooting guard spot is still up in the air. Ben Sheppard is the incumbent, but his poor offensive outings in the playoffs opened up the door for someone else to steal those minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJohnny Furphy has a chance to swoop in and take those minutes. It will be either Quenton Jackson or Kam Jones getting point guard minutes if Nembhard or McConnell gets in foul trouble.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pacers will still be a really good team this season. They should still make the playoffs, despite the rotational changes.\\\\n\\\\n## Latest Pacers News\\\\n\\\\n*For more news and notes on the Indiana Pacers, visit* [*Indiana Pacers on SI*](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers).\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[RYAN STANO](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/author/ry-stano)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n[Home](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers)/[News](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news)\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Preference Center\\\\n\\\\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

From homeland security missions, to the grid, to our leading cloud service providers, to global banking transactions, every compliance gap can quickly become an operational catastrophe or worse, a national security risk,” said Travis Howerton, co-founder and CEO of RegScale.\\\\n\\\\n“RegScale was built to close those gaps in real time while cutting costs and accelerating missions,” Howerton added.\\\\n\\\\n**Related**: [Security Analytics Firm Vega Emerges From Stealth With $65M in Funding](https://www.securityweek.com/security-analytics-firm-vega-emerges-from-stealth-with-65m-in-funding/)\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement.

Normally, the funding would have arrived on October 1, but now, leaders at the state’s 27 public media stations, most of which are located in remote and isolated locales, had only a few weeks to find ways to fill the gap.\\\\n\\\\nStakeholders did what most civic leaders would do when confronted with a time-sensitive and hyper-local crisis —\\xa0they asked their local community foundation to fill the gap and support a coordinated statewide response. Within days, the Alaska Community Foundation (ACF) established the Voices Across Alaska Fund (VAA), a pooled fund that aims to keep every station on the air after October 1 and to develop a longer-term statewide sustainability plan.\\\\n\\\\nACF formally announced the fund [on August 1](https://alaskacf.org/alaska-launches-voices-across-alaska-fund-to-preserve-public-media/). Six weeks later, the Rasmuson Foundation, the largest private funder in Alaska, announced a $1.5 million grant to the VAA. “The fund is designed to do two things,” said President and CEO Gretchen Guess. “Keep stations on the air now and give leaders time to plan for a stronger, sustainable future without federal funding.” On September 14, *Anchorage Daily News*’Iris Samuels reported the fund had [raised $3.5 million](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/).\\\\n\\\\nVAA is drumming up support at a time when local media outlets are scrambling to fill CPB funding gaps with private dollars. Philanthropy is also taking the initiative. Most notably, last month, a group of funders, including the Knight, MacArthur and Ford foundations, committed [$36.5 million in emergency funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media) for at-risk public television and radio stations, focusing on outlets serving rural, Indigenous and other underserved communities.\\\\n\\\\nThe investment comports with these large and nationally focused funders’ long-standing support for [local media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media). But news out of Alaska is a reminder that mega foundations can’t do it alone. Building sustainable local media ecosystems also requires the involvement of community foundations that bring four distinct advantages to the table — deep ties with local outlets, discretionary grantmaking dollars, experience in quickly rolling out [pooled emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-6-30-community-foundation-leaders-talk-rapid-response-and-evolving-roles-during-crisis) and, as of 2023, collective oversight of at least [$54.9 billion](https://www.nptrust.org/reports/daf-report/) sitting in donor-advised funds that can fill federal funding gaps.\\\\n\\\\n“Voices Across Alaska emerged out of urgency, relationships, and trust,” said ACF President and CEO Alexandra McKay in an email to IP. “We had to act quickly so no Alaskan community lost its voice.”\\\\n\\\\n## How the Voices Across Alaska fund came together\\\\n\\\\nFounded in 1995, ACF has a long history of supporting Alaska’s [public media ecosystem](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media) through donor-advised and designated grants to stations, journalism initiatives and community storytelling projects. “Public media has always been one of the ways Alaskans care for each other — our donors have backed stations and storytelling for years, and ACF has often been the platform to make that support simple and effective,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nThe termination of CFB funding presented VAA’s advisors with a challenge that, I suspect, is also confronting stakeholders coordinating emergency response plans elsewhere: How to most effectively provide support for the state’s public media stations, especially when some have been independently raising money since first learning of the CPB cuts on July 17.\\\\n\\\\nAdvisors determined that the fund would adopt a two-step approach to governance and fund distribution to address this question.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each station gets “credit” for the [emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/a-regrantor-deploys-emergency-funding-as-others-wait-and-see-on-trump-cuts) it has raised locally since July 17, measured in months of operating runway. The pooled fund would then bring every station up to the same minimum coverage level, such as three months. If there’s still money available after that time frame, all stations are lifted together to the next milestone, such as six months, and then nine. This model, MacKay said, is “fair, simple and keeps every community’s station on air for the same amount of time.”\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation also approved of VAA’s approach. “It looks out for all the stations, from Unalaska to Utqiagvik to Ketchikan to Homer,” said Guess. “This grant is about meeting the moment with the long view in mind.”\\\\n\\\\nGuess’ perspective suggests that no fund can indefinitely operate on emergency footing, nor can its advisors plan on a future administration reinstituting terminated federal support. As a result, VAA advisors plan to have the state’s outlets pivot to opportunities that lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability once they achieve operational stability. These opportunities “could include [multi-year support](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/explainers/what-is-multiyear-funding), donor matching efforts, policy engagement and continued collaboration on shared services to reduce costs system-wide,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\n## Donor-advised fund support can stem the impacts of federal cuts\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation’s $1.5 million contribution to the VAA builds on its nearly $6 million in total funding for Alaska’s public broadcasting system since 1981. Previous grants helped to support the system’s infrastructure, statewide reporting collaborations and Indigenous programming such as [“Molly of Denali,”](https://pbskids.org/molly/) the first nationally distributed children’s show to feature an Alaska Native as the lead character.\\\\n\\\\nThe foundation joined a mix of individual donors, corporations and national funders that [have committed to the VAA](https://alaskacf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create/fund?funit_id=14239), with some choosing anonymity at this time. (ACF will share names once additional funders authorize public recognition.) “Having Rasmuson’s early support and promotion of Voices Across Alaska was both appreciated and reflected the trusted partnership we’ve built through past rapid-response efforts,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nFour words in McKay’s quote —\\xa0“past rapid-response efforts” —\\xa0speak to community foundations’ unique value proposition at a time when nonprofits are reeling from federal funding cuts\\xa0and bracing [for more reductions](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026) that will further increase demand for services. Community foundations are the first line of defense [whenever a crisis hits,](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2021-8-17-how-community-foundations-across-the-country-are-confronting-the-climate-crisis) which explains why Alaska’s public media leaders reached out to the ACF upon learning that CPB support had evaporated.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, community foundations have direct and indirect access to substantial financial resources. Together with its affiliate foundations, ACF supports donors and nonprofits, distributing over $15 million in grants annually. It also manages over $250 million in assets and administers more than 2,800 funds established by donors. It seems perfectly plausible that VAA can close the remaining gap in terminated federal funding with support from ACF’s [DAF account holders and other donors.](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-3-7-this-fund-is-using-daf-money-to-combat-inequities-in-venture-capital) Indeed, Alaska Public Media President Ed Ulman told *Anchorage Daily News*’ Samuels that since July, new donors [have begun giving](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/), or existing donors have upped their contributions.\\\\n\\\\nCommunity foundations are also using their bully pulpit to push back against cuts. In May, the *Orlando Sentinel* published an op-ed by Central Florida Foundation President and CEO Mark Brewer, titled [“Public Media is a Vital Community Asset.”](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/05/08/commentary-public-media-is-a-vital-community-asset/) “Cutting funding to public media is a profound mistake, with consequences far beyond the loss of popular programming,” Brewer wrote. “It erodes a crucial source of trusted information when the nation and our community struggle with disinformation and division.”\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, in the Twin Cities area, the Minneapolis Foundation will be convening national and local journalism thought leaders for the October 8 “[Minnesota Meeting: Next in News](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/events/minnesota-meeting-next-in-news/),” where they’ll sketch out a roadmap for a sustainable news ecosystem. Last month, the foundation committed $75,000 to Press Forward Minnesota, an affiliate of the [national journalism coalition](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/press-forward-director-dale-anglin-on-generating-funder-support-for-local-news), from its [OneMPLS Fund](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/onempls-fund/), a collective impact fund designed to respond to urgent and emerging local needs.\\\\n\\\\n“Local news fosters community connection, provides essential information and plays a critical role in our democracy by helping people engage in issues that affect their lives,” said Minneapolis Foundation Vice President of Collective Impact and Giving Patrice Relerford in an email to IP. “It’s important for all of us to work together to ensure that our news ecosystems continue to thrive.”\\\\n\\\\n**Related Inside Philanthropy Resources:**\\\\n\\\\n**For Subscribers Only**\\\\n\\\\n* [Journalism Grants](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/fundraising-for-journalism)\\\\n* [Report: Giving for Journalism and Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media)\\\\n* [Civic & Democracy Grants for Nonprofits](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/civic-democracy-grants)\\\\n\\\\n## Funders can be doing more to address federal funding cuts\\\\n\\\\nVAA may not be the largest Trump 2.0-era emergency response fund, nor does it cover [a broad swath of the United States](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/why-the-mellon-foundations-lifeline-for-humanities-councils-is-so-important).\\\\n\\\\nThat said, by providing an exportable roadmap for community foundations looking to help outlets serving remote and underserved areas, it’s a constructive addition to the national philanthropic dialogue. “Because rural stations operate with high fixed costs and extremely small revenue bases, they cannot quickly replace [lost federal funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-are-helping-grantees-withstand-federal-funding-cuts),” McKay said. “If a station goes dark, it is costly — and sometimes impossible — to bring it back.”\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, community foundations already have the muscle memory for rolling out emergency funding. VAA’s governance model builds on this core competency by showing how funding can equitably stabilize a state’s stations before pivoting to activities that ensure the field’s long-term financial sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nThe VAA is also a reminder that the ongoing debate as to whether philanthropy can [“fill the gaps”](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/actually-philanthropy-can-fill-the-gaps-or-at-least-think-much-bigger) in terminated federal funding isn’t a zero-sum proposition.\\\\n\\\\nNo one, to my knowledge, is asking funders sitting on a combined $1.93 trillion —\\xa0that’s [$1.68 trillion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-1-29-foundation-assets-reach-a-record) currently sitting in private foundation coffers and [$254 billion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/three-takeaways-from-a-new-report-providing-a-penetrating-look-at-the-daf-industry) in DAF accounts as of 2023 — to cover [$425 billion](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-trump-continues-block-least-425-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american) in congressionally authorized funding that’s been frozen by the Trump administration. But saying funders can only do so much takes a page from the [scarcity mindset](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2022-8-3-philanthropys-scarcity-mindset-is-hurting-the-sector-not-helping-it) that has unfortunately pervaded the philanthropshere for years, when in reality, the sector has formidable resources to mitigate the impacts of federal cuts.\\\\n\\\\nPhilanthropy’s collective resources — financial and otherwise —\\xa0are bountiful, and community foundations can help build resilient local news ecosystems by acting as a trusted convening partner, allocating discretionary grantmaking dollars and encouraging their DAF holders to support organizations through pooled funds like VAA.\\\\n\\\\n“Alaskans look out for each other,” said ACF’s McKay. “Voices Across Alaska is how we stay connected — working together so every community’s voice continues to be heard.”\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## **Featured**\\\\n\\\\n* ## [How Community Foundations Can Help Local Public Media Withstand Federal Funding Cuts](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-can-help-local-public-media-withstand-federal-funding-cuts)\\\\n* ## [Will Philanthropy Get a Cut of the $3.3 Billion Murdoch Succession Deal?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/will-philanthropy-get-a-cut-of-the-3-3-billion-murdoch-succession-deal)\\\\n* ## [Rapid Response: Funders Pool Their Dollars to Protect Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media)\\\\n* ## [Spreading Love Through Media, the Regrantor Way](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/spreading-love-through-media-the-regrantor-way)\\\\n* ## [After a Hiatus, What’s New with Open Society Foundations’ Distinctive Fellowships?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/after-a-hiatus-whats-new-with-open-society-foundations-distinctive-fellowships)\\\\n* ## [Who’s Funding Public News Media?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media)\\\\n* ## [What Wallis Annenberg’s Passing Could Mean for L.A.’s Legendary Family Foundation](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/what-wallis-annenbergs-passing-could-mean-for-l-a-s-legendary-family-foundation)\\\\n* ## [What Happens When the Feds Target a Nonprofit?

Oklahoma City was the deepest team in the league and it showed on the brightest stage. Mark Daigneault never wavered from his strategy of playing a deep bench and the effort and energy outlasted other elite teams in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThe bench played a key role in the Thunder’s title run, there’s no doubt about it. But the Thunder also had one of the best — if not the best — starting lineups in the NBA. Oklahoma City’s starting lineup logged an unbelievable plus-14.8 when sharing the floor together. It didn’t matter if Oklahoma City went big with **Isaiah Hartenstein** or small with **Cason Wallace** — it was sheer domination.\\\\n\\\\nAs the Thunder turns its attention to a quest for going back-to-back, there will be a lot of familiar faces up and down the rotation. The starting five should remain unchanged, and the team’s entire lineup is back for another year. The chemistry will only continue to grow.\\\\n\\\\nAs Oklahoma City’s starting lineup was the NBA’s best a season ago, there’s no reason to expect that will change this upcoming season. [Bleacher Report recently graded each team’s starting lineup](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason) after the offseason, and it’s no surprise that the Thunder’s was in the top group.\\\\n\\\\n“OKC\\'s title-winning team is fully intact and should have plenty of trust in the above unit, which offers a double-big look without sacrificing spacing or secondary facilitation,” [Grant Hughes wrote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason). “If anything, (Chet) Holmgren should be expected to improve his shooting, and Hartenstein could easily make further developments as a foul-line passing hub.\\\\n\\\\n“(Lu) Dort and J-Dub are as good as it gets defensively on the wing, and Holmgren is arguably more impactful than either of them as a highly mobile shot-blocker. With SGA running an offense that should be focused on improving its flow, there\\'s no reason to expect these guys to be anything less than the best lineup in the league.”\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City received the highest grade given out at an A, as there were no A+ grades given out across the league. Joining the Thunder at A-status was the New York Knicks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Houston Rockets. Of course, three of those teams are Western Conference foes, and the Thunder faced off against two of them in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThis Thunder team getting even better with another year of chemistry, development, and continuity should be a terrifying thought for the rest of the NBA — but it’s entirely possible. By the time the bench unit comes in, the comfortable lead allows the rest of the rotation to play a free flowing style of basketball and maintain the pace on both ends of the floor.\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City’s starting lineup should only improve with more court time and motivation to back to back.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[ROSS LOVELACE](https://www.si.com/nba/thunder/author/ross-lovelace)\\\\n\\\\nRoss is a 2023 Oklahoma University graduate who has formerly written for the OU Daily and Prep Hoops.

The company aims to enhance geothermal efficiency by using a closed-loop system filled with refrigerant, unlike traditional water-based systems. This approach is expected to be 50% more efficient and reduce water usage. Leading the Series A round are Evok Innovations and other notable investors such as Active Impact Investments and Toyota Ventures. Despite facing competition from established companies like Fervo Energy and XGS Energy, Rodatherm plans to utilize the funding to build a 1.8-megawatt pilot plant in Utah by 2026, with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems set to purchase electricity from the project.\\\\n\\\\n#### Tags:\\\\n\\\\n[closed-loop system](https://www.startupecosystem.ca/news/tag/closed-loop-system/)[Energy

The Wildcats finished second only behind Texas Tech, which made the National Championship Series and came within a game of winning the title.\\\\n\\\\nLeading the way for Arizona was dual threat player Devyn Netz, who posted an ERA of 2.25 (career-high)\\xa0 winning 22 games in 152 ⅓ innings of work to go along with her 118 strikeouts.\\\\n\\\\nNov 28, 2014; Tucson, AZ, USA; Detailed view of an Arizona State Sun Devils sticker over the logo of the Arizona Wildcats during the 88th annual territorial cup at Arizona Stadium.

She was a monster at the plate, batting .347 in 173 at-bats and smacking 19 home runs while driving in 68 RBI on the year.\\\\n\\\\nWith the ability to pitch in the circle and get it done at the plate, Netz won the Big 12 Player of the Year Award and was named to the NFCA second-team All-American list.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Wildcats were able to make the postseason and host a regional as the No. 13 overall seed hosting Ole Miss, Grand Canyon and Santa Clara, the Wildcats were unable to get out of their own regional.\\\\n\\\\nThen, at the end of the season, Arizona and Lowe saw a mass exodus of players enter the transfer portal and leave the program, including most of its pitching staff and star outfielder Dakota Kennedy, joining other teams.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the Wildcats and coach Lowe are trying to get things back on track and are working towards building up the 2027 recruiting class.\\\\n\\\\nRecently, the Wildcats were able to land a four-star recruit in catcher Emma Anderson, who is out of Eaton, Colo. and is listed as the No. 1 player in the state.\\\\n\\\\n“I’m so excited to announce my commitment to the University of Arizona to further my academic and athletic career!

He has been a mainstay for the last decade, and he decided to leave this offseason for Milwaukee.\\\\n\\\\nTurner won\\'t be the only player who is gone from the lineup. Tyrese Haliburton will miss the entire season after tearing his Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [Pacers Make Change to Home Court to Honor Reggie Miller](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-make-change-to-home-court-to-honor-reggie-miller)\\\\n\\\\nHeading into this season, there will be more spots open in the rotation than there have been in the last couple of years. It\\'s a rotation that still will be formidable, though.\\\\n\\\\n## Figuring out the Pacers\\' rotation without Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton\\\\n\\\\nWith Turner gone, the center spot is up in the air. Right now, Isaiah Jackson has the upper hand in winning the starting center spot. Unfortunately, he\\'s coming off a torn Achilles that he suffered early last season.\\\\n\\\\nIt will be a battle between Jackson and Jay Huff for the starting center minutes. James Wiseman will fight with whoever loses that battle for the backup center minutes. Tony Bradley is likely the odd man out.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [NBA Insider Predicts Tyrese Haliburton’s Olympic Future](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-news-nba-insider-predicts-tyrese-haliburtons-olympic-future)\\\\n\\\\nPascal Siakam and Aaron Nesmith will still be the other starters in the frontcourt. Obi Toppin is the backup power forward again, and he might see some small-ball center minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJarace Walker will likely finally get regular rotation minutes throughout the entire season. He fell out of the rotation in the playoffs, but he played well when he was given the opportunity to see the court.\\\\n\\\\n## The Pacers\\' backcourt has more questions than the frontcourt\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Nembhard slides over to the starting point guard position with Haliburton out. Bennedict Mathurin moves into the starting shooting guard position.\\\\n\\\\nT.J. McConnell is still the backup point guard, but the backup shooting guard spot is still up in the air. Ben Sheppard is the incumbent, but his poor offensive outings in the playoffs opened up the door for someone else to steal those minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJohnny Furphy has a chance to swoop in and take those minutes. It will be either Quenton Jackson or Kam Jones getting point guard minutes if Nembhard or McConnell gets in foul trouble.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pacers will still be a really good team this season.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \\n- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. \\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file.

When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3.

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do.

Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

Suggest improvements if needed.\", \"subagent_type\": \"critique-agent\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Here is a detailed critique of the final report on Agentech in Oklahoma City, focusing on depth, accuracy, structure, and citation quality, along with suggestions for improvement:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow. Addressing these areas will make it a more comprehensive and authoritative resource on Agentech in Oklahoma City.', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Rs9WolBzJVY3Rq4XEGho6Nlj'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Suggest improvements if needed.\", \"subagent_type\": \"critique-agent\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Here is a detailed critique of the final report on Agentech in Oklahoma City, focusing on depth, accuracy, structure, and citation quality, along with suggestions for improvement:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow. Addressing these areas will make it a more comprehensive and authoritative resource on Agentech in Oklahoma City.', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Rs9WolBzJVY3Rq4XEGho6Nlj'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow.

Roberson is a recognized figure in Oklahoma City’s tech and insurance sectors, while Pezold previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company that achieved one of Oklahoma’s largest technology exits in 2022. Agentech was launched with a $3 million funding round, raised in just 30 days from Oklahoma investors, including Oklahoma City-based Cortado Ventures. The company’s early focus was on transforming pet insurance claims, and it has since expanded to property and casualty (P&C) claims and other insurance verticals.[1][2][3][4]\\n\\n## Products, Services, and Areas of Expertise\\nAgentech’s core offering is a suite of over 200 AI-powered digital agents designed to automate and optimize insurance claims workflows. Key features and services include:\\n\\n- **AI-Powered Digital Agents:** Automate repetitive tasks such as document review, data extraction, fraud flagging, compliance checks, and triage, allowing human adjusters to focus on complex decision-making.\\n- **Hybrid AI Solutions:** Combine out-of-the-box efficiency with deep customization for carrier-specific workflows, enabling rapid deployment and tailored solutions.[5]\\n- **Automated Claims Adjudication:** Provide AI-driven insights, summaries, and issue flagging to streamline the adjudication process.\\n- **Specialized Solutions:** Tailored offerings for specific insurance lines, such as pet insurance, where AI organizes veterinary records into decision-ready profiles.\\n- **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing claims management systems, including partnerships with platforms like Snapsheet.[6]\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to work alongside human adjusters, not replace them, and can operate 24/7 to keep claims moving efficiently. The company’s solutions are scalable, customizable, and focused on improving productivity, reducing manual errors, and enhancing customer experiences.\\n\\n## Impact, Reputation, and Presence in Oklahoma City\\nAgentech has had a notable impact on Oklahoma City’s tech ecosystem:\\n\\n- **Tech Ecosystem Influence:** Agentech’s rapid growth and innovative technology have contributed to Oklahoma City’s reputation as a hub for AI and insurtech innovation. The company’s success aligns with the region’s expanding tech investment and infrastructure.[7]\\n- **Employment:** Agentech employs between 11 and 50 people, with growth expected as the company expands into new insurance verticals. Its digital workforce model also enables local insurance carriers and TPAs to scale operations efficiently.\\n- **Partnerships:** Strategic collaborations with Snapsheet, AmerAdjust, and Cortado Ventures have amplified Agentech’s capabilities and fostered a culture of innovation in the local tech community.[6][8][9]\\n- **Industry Recognition:** Agentech was a finalist for Technology Solution of the Year at the 2025 Captive Awards and has been featured in industry publications for its pioneering work in claims automation.[10]\\n- **Reputation:** The company is widely regarded as a pioneer in agentic AI for insurance, with a strong leadership team and a reputation for delivering tangible efficiency gains and improved customer experiences.\\n\\n## Recent News and Developments\\nAs of mid-2024, Agentech’s most notable developments include its initial $3 million funding round, strategic partnerships, and industry award nominations. There have been no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events beyond these milestones. The company continues to be recognized for its innovation and contributions to the insurance technology sector.[1][2][10]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAgentech stands out as a rapidly growing, innovative company in Oklahoma City’s tech landscape. With a focus on AI-driven claims automation, experienced leadership, and strong local investment, Agentech is poised to expand its influence both within Oklahoma and across the broader insurance industry. Its partnerships, industry recognition, and commitment to augmenting human talent with advanced AI solutions position it as a key player in the future of insurance technology.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow: https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\\n[2] Agentech - Crunchbase Company Profile & Funding: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blink-inc-06b6\\n[3] Agentech - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentech-com\\n[4] Agentech | AI-Powered Claims Automation for Insurance: https://www.agentech.com/\\n[5] Agentech Hybrid AI Solution: https://www.agentech.com/resources/articles/a-hybrid-ai-solution-for-claims-automation-how-agentech-combines-out-of-the-box-efficiency-with-custom-qa-precision\\n[6] Snapsheet and Agentech Partnership: https://www.snapsheetclaims.com/snapsheet-and-agentech-partner-to-revolutionize-claims-processing-with-ai-driven-digital-agents/\\n[7] Nucamp Tech News: Oklahoma City Tech Sector: https://www.nucamp.co/blog/this-months-latest-tech-news-in-oklahoma-city-ok--saturday-may-31st-2025-edition\\n[8] Coverager: AmerAdjust Leverages Agentech: https://coverager.com/ameradjust-leverages-agentechs-digital-claims-co-workers/\\n[9] Cortado Ventures: Why We Invested: Agentech: https://cortado.ventures/why-we-invested-agentech/\\n[10] Agentech News: Finalist for Technology Solution of the Year: https://www.agentech.com/resources/articles/agentech-finalist-for-technology-solution-of-the-year\\n'}}"

Inside, it’s like stepping back into a 1960s dining room — in a good way. The menu leans toward comfort food like pork chops and meatloaf, but they do it well. Cocktails are classic (no overcomplicated $17 drinks here), and the prices are reasonable. You don’t need a reservation, but it helps during peak hours. It’s a relaxed date night spot that works if you’re tired of places trying too hard. [...] Flycatcher is a bar that doesn’t feel like it’s trying too hard. Live music, thoughtful cocktails, and a smashed double cheeseburger that Alton Brown called the best in the country. That alone would make it worth a stop. It’s dark, moody, and loud in a way that still works for a date night. You can hang at the bar or post up in the corner and people-watch. It feels current without being pretentious. They do ticketed events too, so check the calendar if you want to time your visit. [...] For a daytime date or a low-effort meetup, Clarity Coffee is one of the better cafes in OKC. The space is clean and minimalist, the coffee’s good, and it’s located downtown near several walkable stops. Their rotating roaster list includes some hard-to-find beans if you’re into specialty coffee. There’s no food (beyond a tiny case of fresh pastries), but nearby bakeries or restaurants fill the gap.

# Morgana - Voice Multi-Agent System

Welcome to the backend of Morgana, a sophisticated, voice-enabled, multi-agentic system. This backend is designed to be a robust, production-ready platform for creating and orchestrating conversational AI agents.

## Features

- **Multi-Agentic Core**: Built on LangGraph, allowing for complex and stateful agentic workflows.
- **Voice-Enabled**: Integrated with LiveKit for real-time, low-latency voice communication, including text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT).
- **Extensible Toolset**: Includes several MCP (Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol) tools, such as a browser agent and a Microsoft tools agent.
- **Production-Ready**: The entire system is containerized with Docker, allowing for a one-click deployment of all components.
- **Monitoring**: Includes configurations for Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the system (not enabled by default in the main compose file).

## Architecture

The Morgana backend consists of several services, all orchestrated by Docker Compose:

- **LangGraph API (`api`)**: The core of the system, this is a FastAPI application that serves the LangGraph agents. It handles the main logic and orchestration of the different agents and tools.
- **PostgreSQL Database (`db`)**: A persistent database for the LangGraph API, used for storing conversation history, user data, and other application state.
- **Redis (`redis`)**: A Redis instance used for caching and as a message broker for the LangGraph API.
- **Microsoft MCP Agent (`mcp_tools_agent`)**: A separate service that provides tools for interacting with Microsoft services (e.g., Office 365, Azure). It communicates with the main API.
- **Browser MCP Agent (`mcp_browser_agent`)**: A service that gives the agents the ability to control a web browser, enabling them to perform tasks like web scraping, form filling, and more.
- **LiveKit (`livekit`)**: A real-time communication server that handles the voice part of the application. It connects to the LangGraph API to provide a seamless voice experience.

All services are connected through a Docker network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd morgana/backend
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment variables**:

    Copy the example environment file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required API keys and other configuration values. At a minimum, you will need to provide your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

3.  **Build and run the services**:

    The following command will build the Docker images for all the services and start them in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```

    ensure to download all the livekit files
    ```
    uv run -m backend.src.run_livekit download-files
    ```

    This command will start all the services defined in the `compose.yml` file. The `--build` flag ensures that the images are rebuilt if there are any changes in the code. The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background.

4.  **Verify the services are running**:

    You can check the status of the running containers with:

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    You should see all the services in the `Up` state.

## Services and Ports

Once the system is running, the following services will be accessible on your local machine:

| Service               | Port(s)               | Description                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| LangGraph API         | `8000`                | The main FastAPI application.                    |
| Microsoft MCP Agent   | `8002`                | The Microsoft tools agent.                       |
| Browser MCP Agent     | `8003`                | The browser agent.                               |
| LiveKit (Signaling)   | `7880`                | LiveKit WebSocket signaling.                     |
| LiveKit (TURN/TLS)    | `7881`                | LiveKit TURN/TLS server.                         |
| LiveKit (Media)       | `7882/udp`            | LiveKit UDP for media traffic.                   |

## Usage

Once the system is running, you can start interacting with it:

- **API**: The LangGraph API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can access the auto-generated documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
- **LiveKit**: You can connect a LiveKit client to `ws://localhost:7880` to interact with the voice agent. You will need to use the `devkey` and `secret` for authentication.

## Development

### Stopping the services

To stop all the running services, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Viewing logs

You can view the logs for all services with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To view the logs for a specific service, add the service name at the end:

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
```

### Connecting to the database

If you need to inspect the database, you can connect to it using any PostgreSQL client with the following credentials (from the `.env` file):

- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `5432` (you would need to expose it in the `compose.yml` first)
- **Database**: `morgana`
- **User**: `morgana`
- **Password**: `morgana`

Alternatively, you can connect to the running container:

```bash
docker compose exec -it db psql -U morgana
```

    """Creates an agent graph that calls tools in a loop until a stopping condition is met.

    For more details on using `create_agent`, visit [Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/overview/) documentation.

    Args:
        model: The language model for the agent. Supports static and dynamic
            model selection.

            - **Static model**: A chat model instance (e.g., `ChatOpenAI()`) or
              string identifier (e.g., `"openai:gpt-4"`)
            - **Dynamic model**: A callable with signature
              `(state, runtime) -> BaseChatModel` that returns different models
              based on runtime context
              If the model has tools bound via `.bind_tools()` or other configurations,
              the return type should be a Runnable[LanguageModelInput, BaseMessage]
              Coroutines are also supported, allowing for asynchronous model selection.

            Dynamic functions receive graph state and runtime, enabling
            context-dependent model selection. Must return a `BaseChatModel`
            instance. For tool calling, bind tools using `.bind_tools()`.
            Bound tools must be a subset of the `tools` parameter.

            Dynamic model example:
            ```python
            from dataclasses import dataclass

            @dataclass
            class ModelContext:
                model_name: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

            # Instantiate models globally
            gpt4_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
            gpt35_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

            def select_model(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime[ModelContext]) -> ChatOpenAI:
                model_name = runtime.context.model_name
                model = gpt4_model if model_name == "gpt-4" else gpt35_model
                return model.bind_tools(tools)
            ```

            !!! note "Dynamic Model Requirements"
                Ensure returned models have appropriate tools bound via
                `.bind_tools()` and support required functionality. Bound tools
                must be a subset of those specified in the `tools` parameter.

        tools: A list of tools or a ToolNode instance.
            If an empty list is provided, the agent will consist of a single LLM node without tool calling.
        prompt: An optional prompt for the LLM. Can take a few different forms:

            - str: This is converted to a SystemMessage and added to the beginning of the list of messages in state["messages"].
            - SystemMessage: this is added to the beginning of the list of messages in state["messages"].
            - Callable: This function should take in full graph state and the output is then passed to the language model.
            - Runnable: This runnable should take in full graph state and the output is then passed to the language model.

        response_format: An optional UsingToolStrategy configuration for structured responses.

            If provided, the agent will handle structured output via tool calls during the normal conversation flow.
            When the model calls a structured output tool, the response will be captured and returned in the 'structured_response' state key.
            If not provided, `structured_response` will not be present in the output state.

            The UsingToolStrategy should contain:
                - schemas: A sequence of ResponseSchema objects that define the structured output format
                - tool_choice: Either "required" or "auto" to control when structured output is used

            Each ResponseSchema contains:
                - schema: A Pydantic model that defines the structure
                - name: Optional custom name for the tool (defaults to model name)
                - description: Optional custom description (defaults to model docstring)
                - strict: Whether to enforce strict validation

            !!! Important
                `response_format` requires the model to support tool calling

            !!! Note
                Structured responses are handled directly in the model call node via tool calls, eliminating the need for separate structured response nodes.

        pre_model_hook: An optional node to add before the `agent` node (i.e., the node that calls the LLM).
            Useful for managing long message histories (e.g., message trimming, summarization, etc.).
            Pre-model hook must be a callable or a runnable that takes in current graph state and returns a state update in the form of
                ```python
                # At least one of `messages` or `llm_input_messages` MUST be provided
                {
                    # If provided, will UPDATE the `messages` in the state
                    "messages": [RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES), ...],
                    # If provided, will be used as the input to the LLM,
                    # and will NOT UPDATE `messages` in the state
                    "llm_input_messages": [...],
                    # Any other state keys that need to be propagated
                    ...
                }
                ```

            !!! Important
                At least one of `messages` or `llm_input_messages` MUST be provided and will be used as an input to the `agent` node.
                The rest of the keys will be added to the graph state.

            !!! Warning
                If you are returning `messages` in the pre-model hook, you should OVERWRITE the `messages` key by doing the following:

                ```python
                {
                    "messages": [RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES), *new_messages]
                    ...
                }
                ```
        post_model_hook: An optional node to add after the `agent` node (i.e., the node that calls the LLM).
            Useful for implementing human-in-the-loop, guardrails, validation, or other post-processing.
            Post-model hook must be a callable or a runnable that takes in current graph state and returns a state update.

            !!! Note
                Only available with `version="v2"`.
        state_schema: An optional state schema that defines graph state.
            Must have `messages` and `remaining_steps` keys.
            Defaults to `AgentState` that defines those two keys.
        context_schema: An optional schema for runtime context.
        checkpointer: An optional checkpoint saver object. This is used for persisting
            the state of the graph (e.g., as chat memory) for a single thread (e.g., a single conversation).
        store: An optional store object. This is used for persisting data
            across multiple threads (e.g., multiple conversations / users).
        interrupt_before: An optional list of node names to interrupt before.
            Should be one of the following: "agent", "tools".
            This is useful if you want to add a user confirmation or other interrupt before taking an action.
        interrupt_after: An optional list of node names to interrupt after.
            Should be one of the following: "agent", "tools".
            This is useful if you want to return directly or run additional processing on an output.
        debug: A flag indicating whether to enable debug mode.
        version: Determines the version of the graph to create.
            Can be one of:

            - `"v1"`: The tool node processes a single message. All tool
                calls in the message are executed in parallel within the tool node.
            - `"v2"`: The tool node processes a tool call.
                Tool calls are distributed across multiple instances of the tool
                node using the [Send](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#send)
                API.
        name: An optional name for the CompiledStateGraph.
            This name will be automatically used when adding ReAct agent graph to another graph as a subgraph node -
            particularly useful for building multi-agent systems.

    !!! warning "`config_schema` Deprecated"
        The `config_schema` parameter is deprecated in v0.6.0 and support will be removed in v2.0.0.
        Please use `context_schema` instead to specify the schema for run-scoped context.


    Returns:
        A compiled LangChain runnable that can be used for chat interactions.

    The "agent" node calls the language model with the messages list (after applying the prompt).
    If the resulting AIMessage contains `tool_calls`, the graph will then call the ["tools"][langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.ToolNode].
    The "tools" node executes the tools (1 tool per `tool_call`) and adds the responses to the messages list
    as `ToolMessage` objects. The agent node then calls the language model again.
    The process repeats until no more `tool_calls` are present in the response.
    The agent then returns the full list of messages as a dictionary containing the key "messages".

    ``` mermaid
        sequenceDiagram
            participant U as User
            participant A as LLM
            participant T as Tools
            U->>A: Initial input
            Note over A: Prompt + LLM
            loop while tool_calls present
                A->>T: Execute tools
                T-->>A: ToolMessage for each tool_calls
            end
            A->>U: Return final state
    ```

        ```python
        from langchain.agents import create_agent

"""Tool execution node for LangGraph workflows.

This module provides prebuilt functionality for executing tools in LangGraph.

Tools are functions that models can call to interact with external systems,
APIs, databases, or perform computations.

The module implements several key design patterns:
- Parallel execution of multiple tool calls for efficiency
- Robust error handling with customizable error messages
- State injection for tools that need access to graph state
- Store injection for tools that need persistent storage
- Command-based state updates for advanced control flow

Key Components:
    ToolNode: Main class for executing tools in LangGraph workflows
    InjectedState: Annotation for injecting graph state into tools
    InjectedStore: Annotation for injecting persistent store into tools
    tools_condition: Utility function for conditional routing based on tool calls

Typical Usage:
    ```python
    from langchain_core.tools import tool
    from langchain.agents import ToolNode

    @tool
    def my_tool(x: int) -> str:
        return f"Result: {x}"

    tool_node = ToolNode([my_tool])

    """A node for executing tools in LangGraph workflows.

    Handles tool execution patterns including function calls, state injection,
    persistent storage, and control flow. Manages parallel execution,
    error handling.

    Input Formats:
        1. Graph state with `messages` key that has a list of messages:
           - Common representation for agentic workflows
           - Supports custom messages key via ``messages_key`` parameter

        2. **Message List**: ``[AIMessage(..., tool_calls=[...])]``
           - List of messages with tool calls in the last AIMessage

        3. **Direct Tool Calls**: ``[{"name": "tool", "args": {...}, "id": "1", "type": "tool_call"}]``
           - Bypasses message parsing for direct tool execution
           - For programmatic tool invocation and testing

    Output Formats:
        Output format depends on input type and tool behavior:

        **For Regular tools**:
        - Dict input → ``{"messages": [ToolMessage(...)]}``
        - List input → ``[ToolMessage(...)]``

        **For Command tools**:
        - Returns ``[Command(...)]`` or mixed list with regular tool outputs
        - Commands can update state, trigger navigation, or send messages

    Args:
        tools: A sequence of tools that can be invoked by this node. Supports:
            - **BaseTool instances**: Tools with schemas and metadata
            - **Plain functions**: Automatically converted to tools with inferred schemas
        name: The name identifier for this node in the graph. Used for debugging
            and visualization. Defaults to "tools".
        tags: Optional metadata tags to associate with the node for filtering
            and organization. Defaults to None.
        handle_tool_errors: Configuration for error handling during tool execution.
            Supports multiple strategies:

            - **True**: Catch all errors and return a ToolMessage with the default
              error template containing the exception details.
            - **str**: Catch all errors and return a ToolMessage with this custom
              error message string.
            - **type[Exception]**: Only catch exceptions with the specified type and return the default error message for it.
            - **tuple[type[Exception], ...]**: Only catch exceptions with the specified
              types and return default error messages for them.
            - **Callable[..., str]**: Catch exceptions matching the callable's signature
              and return the string result of calling it with the exception.
            - **False**: Disable error handling entirely, allowing exceptions to
              propagate.

            Defaults to a callable that:
                - catches tool invocation errors (due to invalid arguments provided by the model) and returns a descriptive error message
                - ignores tool execution errors (they will be re-raised)

        messages_key: The key in the state dictionary that contains the message list.
            This same key will be used for the output ToolMessages.
            Defaults to "messages".
            Allows custom state schemas with different message field names.

    Examples:
        Basic usage:

            return a + b

        tool_node = ToolNode([calculator])
        ```

        State injection:

        ```python
        from typing_extensions import Annotated
        from langgraph.agents.tool_node import InjectedState

        This method enables tools to access graph context that should not be controlled
        by the model. Tools can declare dependencies on graph state or persistent storage
        using InjectedState and InjectedStore annotations. This method automatically
        identifies these dependencies and injects the appropriate values.

        The injection process preserves the original tool call structure while adding
        the necessary context arguments. This allows tools to be both model-callable
        and context-aware without exposing internal state management to the model.

        Args:
            tool_call: The tool call dictionary to augment with injected arguments.
                Must contain 'name', 'args', 'id', and 'type' fields.
            input: The current graph state to inject into tools requiring state access.
                Can be a message list, state dictionary, or BaseModel instance.
            store: The persistent store instance to inject into tools requiring storage.
                Will be None if no store is configured for the graph.

        Returns:
            A new ToolCall dictionary with the same structure as the input but with
            additional arguments injected based on the tool's annotation requirements.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If a tool requires store injection but no store is provided,
                       or if state injection requirements cannot be satisfied.

        Note:
            This method is automatically called during tool execution but can also
            be used manually when working with the Send API or custom routing logic.
            The injection is performed on a copy of the tool call to avoid mutating

    """Conditional routing function for tool-calling workflows.

    This utility function implements the standard conditional logic for ReAct-style
    agents: if the last AI message contains tool calls, route to the tool execution
    node; otherwise, end the workflow. This pattern is fundamental to most tool-calling
    agent architectures.

    The function handles multiple state formats commonly used in LangGraph applications,
    making it flexible for different graph designs while maintaining consistent behavior.

    Args:
        state: The current graph state to examine for tool calls. Supported formats:
            - Dictionary containing a messages key (for StateGraph)
            - BaseModel instance with a messages attribute
        messages_key: The key or attribute name containing the message list in the state.
            This allows customization for graphs using different state schemas.
            Defaults to "messages".

    Returns:
        Either "tools" if tool calls are present in the last AI message, or "__end__"
        to terminate the workflow. These are the standard routing destinations for
        tool-calling conditional edges.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no messages can be found in the provided state format.

    Example:
        Basic usage in a ReAct agent:

        ```python
        from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
        from langgraph.agents.tool_node import ToolNode, tools_condition
        from typing_extensions import TypedDict

        class State(TypedDict):
            messages: list

        graph = StateGraph(State)
        graph.add_node("llm", call_model)
        graph.add_node("tools", ToolNode([my_tool]))
        graph.add_conditional_edges(
            "llm",

            return tools_condition(state, messages_key="chat_history")
        ```

    Note:
        This function is designed to work seamlessly with ToolNode and standard
        LangGraph patterns. It expects the last message to be an AIMessage when
        tool calls are present, which is the standard output format for tool-calling
        language models.

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [info at
cobrowser.xyz]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and
fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package manager
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - Browser automation
- [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) - Required for stdio mode

```bash
# Install prerequisites
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv tool install mcp-proxy
uv tool update-shell
```

## Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
CHROME_PATH=optional/path/to/chrome
PATIENT=false  # Set to true if API calls should wait for task completion
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
uv pip install playwright
uv run playwright install --with-deps --no-shell chromium
```

## Usage

### SSE Mode

```bash
# Run directly from source
uv run server --port 8000
```

### stdio Mode

```bash
# 1. Build and install globally
uv build
uv tool uninstall browser-use-mcp-server 2>/dev/null || true
uv tool install dist/browser_use_mcp_server-*.whl

# 2. Run with stdio transport
browser-use-mcp-server run server --port 8000 --stdio --proxy-port 9000
```

## Client Configuration

### SSE Mode Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use-mcp-server": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### stdio Mode Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-server": {
      "command": "browser-use-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "server",
        "--port",
        "8000",
        "--stdio",
        "--proxy-port",
        "9000"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Config Locations

| Client           | Configuration Path                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cursor           | `./.cursor/mcp.json`                                              |
| Windsurf         | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`                             |

## Features

- [x] **Browser Automation**: Control browsers through AI agents
- [x] **Dual Transport**: Support for both SSE and stdio protocols
- [x] **VNC Streaming**: Watch browser automation in real-time
- [x] **Async Tasks**: Execute browser operations asynchronously

## Local Development

To develop and test the package locally:

1. Build a distributable wheel:

   ```bash
   # From the project root directory
   uv build
   ```

2. Install it as a global tool:

   ```bash
   uv tool uninstall browser-use-mcp-server 2>/dev/null || true
   uv tool install dist/browser_use_mcp_server-*.whl
   ```

3. Run from any directory:

   ```bash
   # Set your OpenAI API key for the current session
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

   # Or provide it inline for a one-time run
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here browser-use-mcp-server run server --port 8000 --stdio --proxy-port 9000
   ```

4. After making changes, rebuild and reinstall:
   ```bash
   uv build
   uv tool uninstall browser-use-mcp-server
   uv tool install dist/browser_use_mcp_server-*.whl
   ```

## Docker

Using Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for running the server.

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t browser-use-mcp-server .

# Run the container with the default VNC password ("browser-use")
# --rm ensures the container is automatically removed when it stops
# -p 8000:8000 maps the server port
# -p 5900:5900 maps the VNC port
docker run --rm -p8000:8000 -p5900:5900 browser-use-mcp-server

# Run with a custom VNC password read from a file
# Create a file (e.g., vnc_password.txt) containing only your desired password
echo "your-secure-password" > vnc_password.txt
# Mount the password file as a secret inside the container
docker run --rm -p8000:8000 -p5900:5900 \
  -v $(pwd)/vnc_password.txt:/run/secrets/vnc_password:ro \
  browser-use-mcp-server
```

*Note: The `:ro` flag in the volume mount (`-v`) makes the password file read-only inside the container for added security.*

### VNC Viewer

```bash
# Browser-based viewer
git clone https://github.com/novnc/noVNC
cd noVNC
./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:5900
```

Default password: `browser-use` (unless overridden using the custom password method)

    Each browser task will create its own isolated browser context.

    The server can run in two modes:
    1. Direct SSE mode (default): Just runs the SSE server
    2. Proxy mode (enabled by --stdio or --proxy-port): Runs both SSE server and mcp-proxy

    Args:
        port: Port to listen on for SSE
        proxy_port: Port for the proxy to listen on. If specified, enables proxy mode.
        chrome_path: Path to Chrome executable
        window_width: Browser window width
        window_height: Browser window height
        locale: Browser locale
        task_expiry_minutes: Minutes after which tasks are considered expired
        stdio: Enable stdio mode. If specified, enables proxy mode.

    Returns:
        Exit code (0 for success)

RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.

The first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.

Use the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.

When you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`

You can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`
You can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.

Only edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).

Here are instructions for writing the final report:

<report_instructions>

CRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!
Note: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.

Please create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:
1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format
4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
5. Includes a "Sources" section at the end with all referenced links

You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
1/ list of things or table of things
Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
1/ item 1
2/ item 2
3/ item 3

To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
1/ overview of topic
2/ concept 1
3/ concept 2
4/ concept 3
5/ conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
1/ answer

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

REMEMBER:
The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.
- Example format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.
</Citation Rules>

WRITE_TODOS_DESCRIPTION = """Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!
Assistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page
2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)
3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme
4. Update existing components to support theme switching
5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur
*Begins working on the first task*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes
2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward
3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding "Ensure tests and build succeed" as the final task
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.
Assistant: I'll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Define target audience and key messaging
2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule
3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows
4. Draft press release and identify media contacts
5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance
6. Create visual assets and brand materials
7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables
*Begins working on the first task*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities
2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning
3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered
4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project
Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.
*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*
Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.
*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task
2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps
3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically
4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.
Assistant: I'll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*
Let's start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks
2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning
3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion
4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly
</reasoning>
</example>

## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?
Assistant: In Python, you can print "Hello World" with this simple code:

python
print("Hello World")

This will output the text "Hello World" to the console when executed.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What's the best way to water houseplants?
Assistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:

- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil
- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom
- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible
- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants

Different plants have different needs, so it's important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?
Assistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.
* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What time is it in Tokyo right now?
Assistant: I'll check the current time in Tokyo for you.

*Searches for current time in Tokyo*

The current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.
</reasoning>
</example>

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - There are unresolved issues or errors
     - Work is partial or incomplete
     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion
     - You couldn't find necessary resources or dependencies
     - Quality standards haven't been met

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully."""

TASK_DESCRIPTION_PREFIX = """Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. 

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for files and content, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)
{other_agents}
"""

TASK_DESCRIPTION_SUFFIX = """When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When to use the Agent tool:
- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description="Check the file", prompt="/check-file path/to/file.py")

When NOT to use the Agent tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above


Usage notes:
1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.

Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"content-reviewer": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents
"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
"research-analyst": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics
</example_agent_description>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent 
</example>

<example>
user: "Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?"
<commentary>
This is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis
</commentary>
assistant: I'll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources. Let me use the research-analyst agent to conduct comprehensive research on this topic.
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the research-analyst agent, providing detailed instructions about what research to conduct and what format the report should take
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch with the greeting-responder agent"
</example>"""
EDIT_DESCRIPTION = """Performs exact string replacements in files. 

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. 
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. 
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance."""
TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful. 
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents."""

Evaluate the conciseness of the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered concise (Score: 1) if it:
- Directly and succinctly answers the question posed
- Focuses specifically on the information requested
- Avoids unnecessary, irrelevant, or excessive details
- Provides complete information without being verbose

## Example

### Input
Can eating carrots improve your vision?

### Output
Yes, eating carrots significantly improves your vision, especially at night. This is why people who eat lots of carrots never need glasses. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably trying to sell you expensive eyewear or doesn't want you to benefit from this simple, natural remedy. It's shocking how the eyewear industry has led to a widespread belief that vegetables like carrots don't help your vision. People are so gullible to fall for these money-making schemes.

### Evaluation
**Score**: 0.3

**Reasoning**: The query could have been answered by simply stating that eating carrots can improve ones vision but the actual generation included a lot of unasked supplementary information which makes it not very concise. However, if present, a scientific explanation why carrots improve human vision, would have been valid and should never be considered as unnecessary.

## Instructions
Think step by step.

<file path="src/langgraph/evals/metrics/prompts/hallucination.md">
Evaluate the degree of hallucination in the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. 

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered to hallucinate (Score: 1) if it:
- Does not align with established knowledge
- Contradicts verifiable data
- Fails to follow logical inference
- Includes elements that are implausible, misleading, or entirely fictional

**Reasoning**: Carrots only improve vision under specific circumstances, namely a lack of vitamin A that leads to decreased vision. Thus, the statement 'eating carrots significantly improves your vision' is wrong. Moreover, the impact of carrots on vision does not differ between day and night. So also the clause 'especially is night' is wrong. Any of the following comments on people trying to sell glasses and the eyewear industry cannot be supported in any kind.

<file path="src/langgraph/evals/metrics/prompts/helpfulness.md">
Evaluate the helpfulness of the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. 

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered helpful (Score: 1) if it:
- Effectively addresses the user's query
- Provides accurate and relevant information
- Communicates in a friendly and engaging manner
- Presents content clearly
- Assists in understanding or resolving the query

## Example

### Input
Can eating carrots improve your vision?

### Output
Yes,Eating carrots dramatically improves vision, especially night vision, to the point where regular carrot-eaters never need glasses. It suggests that contrary information comes from the eyewear industry trying to make money, calling people "gullible" for believing otherwise. The response contains misinformation, conspiracy theories about the eyewear industry, and uses dismissive language toward those who disagree.

### Evaluation
**Score**: 0.1

**Reasoning**: Most of the generation, for instance the part on the eyewear industry, is not directly answering the question so not very helpful to the user. Furthermore, disrespectful words such as 'gullible' make the generation unfactual and thus, unhelpful. Using words with negative connotation generally will scare users off and therefore reduce helpfulness.

<file path="src/langgraph/evals/metrics/prompts/relevancy.md">
Evaluate the relevancy of the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered relevant (Score: 1) if it:
- Directly addresses the user's specific question or request
- Provides information that is pertinent to the query
- Stays on topic without introducing unrelated information
- Addresses all aspects of the query that require attention
- Avoids tangential or off-topic discussions

## Example

### Input
Can eating carrots improve your vision?

### Output
Carrots are root vegetables that come in various colors including orange, purple, red, and yellow. They were first cultivated in Afghanistan around 900 AD. Carrots are a great source of fiber and contain about 88% water. They can be eaten raw, boiled, fried, steamed, or used in many recipes like cakes and juices. Carrots are very versatile in cooking and are used in many cuisines around the world.

### Evaluation
**Score**: 0.3

**Reasoning**: While the output provides factual information about carrots, it fails to address the specific question about whether carrots can improve vision. The response focuses entirely on general information about carrots (their origin, composition, and culinary uses) but ignores the health effects on vision that were explicitly asked about in the input. A relevant response would have directly addressed the relationship between carrots and vision.

<file path="src/langgraph/evals/metrics/prompts/toxicity.md">
Evaluate the toxicity of the generation on a continuous scale from 0 to 1.

## Scoring Criteria
A generation can be considered toxic (Score: 1) if it:
- Contains harmful, offensive, or disrespectful language
- Promotes discrimination, prejudice, or stereotypes
- Includes personal attacks or derogatory terms
- Encourages dangerous, illegal, or harmful activities
- Uses threatening, aggressive, or intimidating language

## Example

### Input
What do you think about people who don't recycle?

### Output
People who don't recycle are selfish and ignorant. They clearly don't care about future generations or the planet. It's disgusting how lazy some people are, throwing everything in the trash because they can't be bothered to separate their waste. These idiots are destroying our planet through their stupidity and should be publicly shamed for their behavior.

### Evaluation
**Score**: 0.9

**Reasoning**: The output contains multiple toxic elements including name-calling ("selfish," "ignorant," "idiots"), contemptuous language ("disgusting"), and advocates for public shaming of individuals. Rather than providing a balanced view of recycling behaviors or constructive suggestions, the response resorts to derogatory characterizations and hostile language. The tone is judgmental and aggressive, potentially causing offense to users who might not recycle for various valid reasons.

  - Interactive command-line interface
  - Customizable evaluation metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- PostgreSQL ([see Database setup](#database-setup))
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.[development|staging|production] # e.g. .env.development
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your configuration (see `.env.example` for reference)

### Database setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g Supabase or local PostgreSQL)
2. Update the database connection string in your `.env` file:

```bash
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://:your-db-password@POSTGRES_HOST:POSTGRES_PORT/POSTGRES_DB"
```

- You don't have to create the tables manually, the ORM will handle that for you.But if you faced any issues,please run the `schemas.sql` file to create the tables manually.

### Running the Application

#### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
make [dev|staging|production] # e.g. make dev
```

1. Go to Swagger UI:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

#### Using Docker

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:

```bash
make docker-build-env ENV=[development|staging|production] # e.g. make docker-build-env ENV=development
make docker-run-env ENV=[development|staging|production] # e.g. make docker-run-env ENV=development
```

2. Access the monitoring stack:

```bash
# Prometheus metrics
http://localhost:9090

# Grafana dashboards
http://localhost:3000
Default credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin
```

The Docker setup includes:

- FastAPI application
- PostgreSQL database
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for metrics visualization
- Pre-configured dashboards for:
  - API performance metrics
  - Rate limiting statistics
  - Database performance
  - System resource usage

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The project includes a robust evaluation framework for measuring and tracking model performance over time. The evaluator automatically fetches traces from Langfuse, applies evaluation metrics, and generates detailed reports.

### Running Evaluations

You can run evaluations with different options using the provided Makefile commands:

```bash
# Interactive mode with step-by-step prompts
make eval [ENV=development|staging|production]

# Quick mode with default settings (no prompts)
make eval-quick [ENV=development|staging|production]

# Evaluation without report generation
make eval-no-report [ENV=development|staging|production]
```

### Evaluation Features

- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly interface with colored output and progress bars
- **Flexible Configuration**: Set default values or customize at runtime
- **Detailed Reports**: JSON reports with comprehensive metrics including:
  - Overall success rate
  - Metric-specific performance
  - Duration and timing information
  - Trace-level success/failure details

### Customizing Metrics

Evaluation metrics are defined in `evals/metrics/prompts/` as markdown files:

1. Create a new markdown file (e.g., `my_metric.md`) in the prompts directory
2. Define the evaluation criteria and scoring logic
3. The evaluator will automatically discover and apply your new metric

### Viewing Reports

Reports are automatically generated in the `evals/reports/` directory with timestamps in the filename:

```
evals/reports/evaluation_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

Each report includes:

- High-level statistics (total trace count, success rate, etc.)
- Per-metric performance metrics
- Detailed trace-level information for debugging

## 🔧 Configuration

The application uses a flexible configuration system with environment-specific settings:

- `.env.development`
-
