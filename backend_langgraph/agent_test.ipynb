Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2.

There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files.

Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4.

Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Our AI-driven technology boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing adjusters to process over 4x the number of claims, enabling them to focus on decision-making and customer service. No more toggling between multiple systems, manually clicking through endless spreadsheets, or struggling with burnout. Agentech’s digital agents instantly handle the tedious work in the background, delivering accurate information to adjusters at key decision points. This allows claim handlers to leverage their expertise for faster claim closures while delivering superior customer experiences. Our carrier partners are already experiencing significant improvements: 4x+ claim output without increasing labor costs Enhanced accuracy and efficiency, reducing manual errors Seamless integration with existing claims workflows While we’ve successfully transformed the pet insurance claims space, Agentech is expanding to support P&C claims processing, with plans to venture into travel, workers\\' comp, gadget, renters, home warranty claims, and more. Our technology takes on the slow, repetitive work—sorting through dense medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents—so adjusters and vet techs can focus on what they do best.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher.

Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\\n\\nUsage:\\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response.

The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. \\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\\n## `task`\\n\\n- When doing web search, prefer to use the `task` tool in order to reduce context usage.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\\nDo a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\\n', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"question.txt\", \"content\": \"Do a deep research on agentech in oklahoma city\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated file question.txt', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_8SZXwG5bu8C74VWwtwK9JhXQ'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'arguments': '{\"todos\": [{\"content\": \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Compile sources and references for the final report.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}, {\"content\": \"Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\", \"status\": \"pending\"}]}'}}]}, {'content': 'Updated todo list to [{\\'content\\': \"Identify what \\'agentech\\' refers to in the context of Oklahoma City (company, technology, or other entity).\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Research the background and history of Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Investigate Agentech\\'s products, services, and areas of expertise.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \"Analyze Agentech\\'s impact, reputation, and presence in Oklahoma City.\", \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Gather recent news, developments, or notable events related to Agentech in Oklahoma City.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Compile sources and references for the final report.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}, {\\'content\\': \\'Write a comprehensive research report in English with proper structure and citations.\\', \\'status\\': \\'pending\\'}]', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_vrqxGcey0eThTnlDlhCICWbO'}, {'content': None, 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'type': 'function', 'id': 'call_OvB2af9NPo3bkF4RFRh0dJnN', 'function': {'name': 'tavily_web_search', 'arguments': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"max_results\": 8, \"search_depth\": \"advanced\"}'}}]}, {'content': '{\"query\": \"Agentech Oklahoma City\", \"follow_up_questions\": null, \"answer\": null, \"images\": [], \"results\": [{\"url\": \"https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\", \"title\": \"Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow\", \"content\": \"OKLAHOMA CITY – An Oklahoma-based startup providing AI-based claims solutions can increase efficiencies and enable companies using the technology to provide swift decisions for their policyholders.\\\\n\\\\nAgentech, powered by hundreds of agentic AI coworkers, significantly boosts claim processing efficiency, allowing desk adjusters and adjudicators to handle more than four times the number of claims without increasing labor costs.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

(Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

brings the total [raised](https://www.securityweek.com/compliance-automation-startup-regscale-scores-20-million-investment/) by the company to more than $50 million, was led by Washington Harbour Partners, with participation from M12, Hitachi Ventures, Ankona Capital, SYN Ventures, and SineWave Ventures.\\\\n\\\\nThe funding will enable [RegScale](https://regscale.com) to grow its go-to-market team and expand the capabilities of its platform.\\\\n\\\\nThe Virginia-based company has developed what it describes as a continuous controls monitoring (CCM) platform that leverages AI agents to continuously monitor compliance, automate evidence collection, conduct audits, and analyze risk.\\\\n\\\\nThe platform is designed to help organizations build compliance programs, continuously monitor various types of risks, and integrate compliance-as-code into DevSecOps processes.\\\\n\\\\n“CISOs are faced with ensuring the systems that keep our country running can withstand increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. From homeland security missions, to the grid, to our leading cloud service providers, to global banking transactions, every compliance gap can quickly become an operational catastrophe or worse, a national security risk,” said Travis Howerton, co-founder and CEO of RegScale.\\\\n\\\\n“RegScale was built to close those gaps in real time while cutting costs and accelerating missions,” Howerton added.\\\\n\\\\n**Related**: [Security Analytics Firm Vega Emerges From Stealth With $65M in Funding](https://www.securityweek.com/security-analytics-firm-vega-emerges-from-stealth-with-65m-in-funding/)\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement.

Normally, the funding would have arrived on October 1, but now, leaders at the state’s 27 public media stations, most of which are located in remote and isolated locales, had only a few weeks to find ways to fill the gap.\\\\n\\\\nStakeholders did what most civic leaders would do when confronted with a time-sensitive and hyper-local crisis —\\xa0they asked their local community foundation to fill the gap and support a coordinated statewide response. Within days, the Alaska Community Foundation (ACF) established the Voices Across Alaska Fund (VAA), a pooled fund that aims to keep every station on the air after October 1 and to develop a longer-term statewide sustainability plan.\\\\n\\\\nACF formally announced the fund [on August 1](https://alaskacf.org/alaska-launches-voices-across-alaska-fund-to-preserve-public-media/). Six weeks later, the Rasmuson Foundation, the largest private funder in Alaska, announced a $1.5 million grant to the VAA. “The fund is designed to do two things,” said President and CEO Gretchen Guess. “Keep stations on the air now and give leaders time to plan for a stronger, sustainable future without federal funding.” On September 14, *Anchorage Daily News*’Iris Samuels reported the fund had [raised $3.5 million](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/).\\\\n\\\\nVAA is drumming up support at a time when local media outlets are scrambling to fill CPB funding gaps with private dollars. Philanthropy is also taking the initiative. Most notably, last month, a group of funders, including the Knight, MacArthur and Ford foundations, committed [$36.5 million in emergency funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media) for at-risk public television and radio stations, focusing on outlets serving rural, Indigenous and other underserved communities.\\\\n\\\\nThe investment comports with these large and nationally focused funders’ long-standing support for [local media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media). But news out of Alaska is a reminder that mega foundations can’t do it alone. Building sustainable local media ecosystems also requires the involvement of community foundations that bring four distinct advantages to the table — deep ties with local outlets, discretionary grantmaking dollars, experience in quickly rolling out [pooled emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-6-30-community-foundation-leaders-talk-rapid-response-and-evolving-roles-during-crisis) and, as of 2023, collective oversight of at least [$54.9 billion](https://www.nptrust.org/reports/daf-report/) sitting in donor-advised funds that can fill federal funding gaps.\\\\n\\\\n“Voices Across Alaska emerged out of urgency, relationships, and trust,” said ACF President and CEO Alexandra McKay in an email to IP. “We had to act quickly so no Alaskan community lost its voice.”\\\\n\\\\n## How the Voices Across Alaska fund came together\\\\n\\\\nFounded in 1995, ACF has a long history of supporting Alaska’s [public media ecosystem](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media) through donor-advised and designated grants to stations, journalism initiatives and community storytelling projects. “Public media has always been one of the ways Alaskans care for each other — our donors have backed stations and storytelling for years, and ACF has often been the platform to make that support simple and effective,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nThe termination of CFB funding presented VAA’s advisors with a challenge that, I suspect, is also confronting stakeholders coordinating emergency response plans elsewhere: How to most effectively provide support for the state’s public media stations, especially when some have been independently raising money since first learning of the CPB cuts on July 17.\\\\n\\\\nAdvisors determined that the fund would adopt a two-step approach to governance and fund distribution to address this question.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each station gets “credit” for the [emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/a-regrantor-deploys-emergency-funding-as-others-wait-and-see-on-trump-cuts) it has raised locally since July 17, measured in months of operating runway. The pooled fund would then bring every station up to the same minimum coverage level, such as three months. If there’s still money available after that time frame, all stations are lifted together to the next milestone, such as six months, and then nine. This model, MacKay said, is “fair, simple and keeps every community’s station on air for the same amount of time.”\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation also approved of VAA’s approach. “It looks out for all the stations, from Unalaska to Utqiagvik to Ketchikan to Homer,” said Guess. “This grant is about meeting the moment with the long view in mind.”\\\\n\\\\nGuess’ perspective suggests that no fund can indefinitely operate on emergency footing, nor can its advisors plan on a future administration reinstituting terminated federal support. As a result, VAA advisors plan to have the state’s outlets pivot to opportunities that lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability once they achieve operational stability. These opportunities “could include [multi-year support](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/explainers/what-is-multiyear-funding), donor matching efforts, policy engagement and continued collaboration on shared services to reduce costs system-wide,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\n## Donor-advised fund support can stem the impacts of federal cuts\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation’s $1.5 million contribution to the VAA builds on its nearly $6 million in total funding for Alaska’s public broadcasting system since 1981. Previous grants helped to support the system’s infrastructure, statewide reporting collaborations and Indigenous programming such as [“Molly of Denali,”](https://pbskids.org/molly/) the first nationally distributed children’s show to feature an Alaska Native as the lead character.\\\\n\\\\nThe foundation joined a mix of individual donors, corporations and national funders that [have committed to the VAA](https://alaskacf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create/fund?funit_id=14239), with some choosing anonymity at this time. (ACF will share names once additional funders authorize public recognition.) “Having Rasmuson’s early support and promotion of Voices Across Alaska was both appreciated and reflected the trusted partnership we’ve built through past rapid-response efforts,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nFour words in McKay’s quote —\\xa0“past rapid-response efforts” —\\xa0speak to community foundations’ unique value proposition at a time when nonprofits are reeling from federal funding cuts\\xa0and bracing [for more reductions](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026) that will further increase demand for services. Community foundations are the first line of defense [whenever a crisis hits,](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2021-8-17-how-community-foundations-across-the-country-are-confronting-the-climate-crisis) which explains why Alaska’s public media leaders reached out to the ACF upon learning that CPB support had evaporated.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, community foundations have direct and indirect access to substantial financial resources. Together with its affiliate foundations, ACF supports donors and nonprofits, distributing over $15 million in grants annually. It also manages over $250 million in assets and administers more than 2,800 funds established by donors. It seems perfectly plausible that VAA can close the remaining gap in terminated federal funding with support from ACF’s [DAF account holders and other donors.](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-3-7-this-fund-is-using-daf-money-to-combat-inequities-in-venture-capital) Indeed, Alaska Public Media President Ed Ulman told *Anchorage Daily News*’ Samuels that since July, new donors [have begun giving](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/), or existing donors have upped their contributions.\\\\n\\\\nCommunity foundations are also using their bully pulpit to push back against cuts. In May, the *Orlando Sentinel* published an op-ed by Central Florida Foundation President and CEO Mark Brewer, titled [“Public Media is a Vital Community Asset.”](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/05/08/commentary-public-media-is-a-vital-community-asset/) “Cutting funding to public media is a profound mistake, with consequences far beyond the loss of popular programming,” Brewer wrote. “It erodes a crucial source of trusted information when the nation and our community struggle with disinformation and division.”\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, in the Twin Cities area, the Minneapolis Foundation will be convening national and local journalism thought leaders for the October 8 “[Minnesota Meeting: Next in News](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/events/minnesota-meeting-next-in-news/),” where they’ll sketch out a roadmap for a sustainable news ecosystem. Last month, the foundation committed $75,000 to Press Forward Minnesota, an affiliate of the [national journalism coalition](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/press-forward-director-dale-anglin-on-generating-funder-support-for-local-news), from its [OneMPLS Fund](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/onempls-fund/), a collective impact fund designed to respond to urgent and emerging local needs.\\\\n\\\\n“Local news fosters community connection, provides essential information and plays a critical role in our democracy by helping people engage in issues that affect their lives,” said Minneapolis Foundation Vice President of Collective Impact and Giving Patrice Relerford in an email to IP. “It’s important for all of us to work together to ensure that our news ecosystems continue to thrive.”\\\\n\\\\n**Related Inside Philanthropy Resources:**\\\\n\\\\n**For Subscribers Only**\\\\n\\\\n* [Journalism Grants](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/fundraising-for-journalism)\\\\n* [Report: Giving for Journalism and Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media)\\\\n* [Civic & Democracy Grants for Nonprofits](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/civic-democracy-grants)\\\\n\\\\n## Funders can be doing more to address federal funding cuts\\\\n\\\\nVAA may not be the largest Trump 2.0-era emergency response fund, nor does it cover [a broad swath of the United States](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/why-the-mellon-foundations-lifeline-for-humanities-councils-is-so-important).\\\\n\\\\nThat said, by providing an exportable roadmap for community foundations looking to help outlets serving remote and underserved areas, it’s a constructive addition to the national philanthropic dialogue. “Because rural stations operate with high fixed costs and extremely small revenue bases, they cannot quickly replace [lost federal funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-are-helping-grantees-withstand-federal-funding-cuts),” McKay said. “If a station goes dark, it is costly — and sometimes impossible — to bring it back.”\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, community foundations already have the muscle memory for rolling out emergency funding. VAA’s governance model builds on this core competency by showing how funding can equitably stabilize a state’s stations before pivoting to activities that ensure the field’s long-term financial sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nThe VAA is also a reminder that the ongoing debate as to whether philanthropy can [“fill the gaps”](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/actually-philanthropy-can-fill-the-gaps-or-at-least-think-much-bigger) in terminated federal funding isn’t a zero-sum proposition.\\\\n\\\\nNo one, to my knowledge, is asking funders sitting on a combined $1.93 trillion —\\xa0that’s [$1.68 trillion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-1-29-foundation-assets-reach-a-record) currently sitting in private foundation coffers and [$254 billion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/three-takeaways-from-a-new-report-providing-a-penetrating-look-at-the-daf-industry) in DAF accounts as of 2023 — to cover [$425 billion](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-trump-continues-block-least-425-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american) in congressionally authorized funding that’s been frozen by the Trump administration. But saying funders can only do so much takes a page from the [scarcity mindset](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2022-8-3-philanthropys-scarcity-mindset-is-hurting-the-sector-not-helping-it) that has unfortunately pervaded the philanthropshere for years, when in reality, the sector has formidable resources to mitigate the impacts of federal cuts.\\\\n\\\\nPhilanthropy’s collective resources — financial and otherwise —\\xa0are bountiful, and community foundations can help build resilient local news ecosystems by acting as a trusted convening partner, allocating discretionary grantmaking dollars and encouraging their DAF holders to support organizations through pooled funds like VAA.\\\\n\\\\n“Alaskans look out for each other,” said ACF’s McKay. “Voices Across Alaska is how we stay connected — working together so every community’s voice continues to be heard.”\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## **Featured**\\\\n\\\\n* ## [How Community Foundations Can Help Local Public Media Withstand Federal Funding Cuts](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-can-help-local-public-media-withstand-federal-funding-cuts)\\\\n* ## [Will Philanthropy Get a Cut of the $3.3 Billion Murdoch Succession Deal?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/will-philanthropy-get-a-cut-of-the-3-3-billion-murdoch-succession-deal)\\\\n* ## [Rapid Response: Funders Pool Their Dollars to Protect Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media)\\\\n* ## [Spreading Love Through Media, the Regrantor Way](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/spreading-love-through-media-the-regrantor-way)\\\\n* ## [After a Hiatus, What’s New with Open Society Foundations’ Distinctive Fellowships?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/after-a-hiatus-whats-new-with-open-society-foundations-distinctive-fellowships)\\\\n* ## [Who’s Funding Public News Media?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media)\\\\n* ## [What Wallis Annenberg’s Passing Could Mean for L.A.’s Legendary Family Foundation](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/what-wallis-annenbergs-passing-could-mean-for-l-a-s-legendary-family-foundation)\\\\n* ## [What Happens When the Feds Target a Nonprofit?

Mandatory Credit: Alonzo Adams-Imagn Images / Alonzo Adams-Imagn Images\\\\n\\\\nIn this story:\\\\n\\\\n* [Oklahoma City Thunder](https://www.si.com/nba/team/oklahoma-city-thunder)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City needed all hands on deck for its magical Finals run. The franchise brought home its first NBA championship after a historic regular season and silenced every doubter along the way.\\\\n\\\\nIt was an organizational effort from top to bottom, but it really was a perfect roster. Oklahoma City was the deepest team in the league and it showed on the brightest stage. Mark Daigneault never wavered from his strategy of playing a deep bench and the effort and energy outlasted other elite teams in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThe bench played a key role in the Thunder’s title run, there’s no doubt about it. But the Thunder also had one of the best — if not the best — starting lineups in the NBA. Oklahoma City’s starting lineup logged an unbelievable plus-14.8 when sharing the floor together. It didn’t matter if Oklahoma City went big with **Isaiah Hartenstein** or small with **Cason Wallace** — it was sheer domination.\\\\n\\\\nAs the Thunder turns its attention to a quest for going back-to-back, there will be a lot of familiar faces up and down the rotation. The starting five should remain unchanged, and the team’s entire lineup is back for another year. The chemistry will only continue to grow.\\\\n\\\\nAs Oklahoma City’s starting lineup was the NBA’s best a season ago, there’s no reason to expect that will change this upcoming season. [Bleacher Report recently graded each team’s starting lineup](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason) after the offseason, and it’s no surprise that the Thunder’s was in the top group.\\\\n\\\\n“OKC\\'s title-winning team is fully intact and should have plenty of trust in the above unit, which offers a double-big look without sacrificing spacing or secondary facilitation,” [Grant Hughes wrote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason). “If anything, (Chet) Holmgren should be expected to improve his shooting, and Hartenstein could easily make further developments as a foul-line passing hub.\\\\n\\\\n“(Lu) Dort and J-Dub are as good as it gets defensively on the wing, and Holmgren is arguably more impactful than either of them as a highly mobile shot-blocker. With SGA running an offense that should be focused on improving its flow, there\\'s no reason to expect these guys to be anything less than the best lineup in the league.”\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City received the highest grade given out at an A, as there were no A+ grades given out across the league. Joining the Thunder at A-status was the New York Knicks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Houston Rockets. Of course, three of those teams are Western Conference foes, and the Thunder faced off against two of them in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThis Thunder team getting even better with another year of chemistry, development, and continuity should be a terrifying thought for the rest of the NBA — but it’s entirely possible. By the time the bench unit comes in, the comfortable lead allows the rest of the rotation to play a free flowing style of basketball and maintain the pace on both ends of the floor.\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City’s starting lineup should only improve with more court time and motivation to back to back.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[ROSS LOVELACE](https://www.si.com/nba/thunder/author/ross-lovelace)\\\\n\\\\nRoss is a 2023 Oklahoma University graduate who has formerly written for the OU Daily and Prep Hoops.

The company aims to enhance geothermal efficiency by using a closed-loop system filled with refrigerant, unlike traditional water-based systems. This approach is expected to be 50% more efficient and reduce water usage. Leading the Series A round are Evok Innovations and other notable investors such as Active Impact Investments and Toyota Ventures. Despite facing competition from established companies like Fervo Energy and XGS Energy, Rodatherm plans to utilize the funding to build a 1.8-megawatt pilot plant in Utah by 2026, with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems set to purchase electricity from the project.\\\\n\\\\n#### Tags:\\\\n\\\\n[closed-loop system](https://www.startupecosystem.ca/news/tag/closed-loop-system/)[Energy

The Wildcats finished second only behind Texas Tech, which made the National Championship Series and came within a game of winning the title.\\\\n\\\\nLeading the way for Arizona was dual threat player Devyn Netz, who posted an ERA of 2.25 (career-high)\\xa0 winning 22 games in 152 ⅓ innings of work to go along with her 118 strikeouts.\\\\n\\\\nNov 28, 2014; Tucson, AZ, USA; Detailed view of an Arizona State Sun Devils sticker over the logo of the Arizona Wildcats during the 88th annual territorial cup at Arizona Stadium.

She was a monster at the plate, batting .347 in 173 at-bats and smacking 19 home runs while driving in 68 RBI on the year.\\\\n\\\\nWith the ability to pitch in the circle and get it done at the plate, Netz won the Big 12 Player of the Year Award and was named to the NFCA second-team All-American list.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Wildcats were able to make the postseason and host a regional as the No. 13 overall seed hosting Ole Miss, Grand Canyon and Santa Clara, the Wildcats were unable to get out of their own regional.\\\\n\\\\nThen, at the end of the season, Arizona and Lowe saw a mass exodus of players enter the transfer portal and leave the program, including most of its pitching staff and star outfielder Dakota Kennedy, joining other teams.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the Wildcats and coach Lowe are trying to get things back on track and are working towards building up the 2027 recruiting class.\\\\n\\\\nRecently, the Wildcats were able to land a four-star recruit in catcher Emma Anderson, who is out of Eaton, Colo. and is listed as the No. 1 player in the state.\\\\n\\\\n“I’m so excited to announce my commitment to the University of Arizona to further my academic and athletic career! Thank you Caitlin Lowe, Lauren Lappin, Amber Freeman and Christian Conrad for blessing me with this opportunity,” said Anderson. “A special thanks to Coach Marty, Coach Dena, and the ENTIRE CA family. To my family, thank you for all the sacrifices you took to get me here. Next stop, Tucson!”\\\\n\\\\nArizona will be trying to not only get back into the postseason but develop talent to make a run to a WCWS appearance.\\\\n\\\\nPlease be sure to share your thoughts on the Wildcats landing four-star catcher Emma Anderson for the 2027 recruiting class.

He has been a mainstay for the last decade, and he decided to leave this offseason for Milwaukee.\\\\n\\\\nTurner won\\'t be the only player who is gone from the lineup. Tyrese Haliburton will miss the entire season after tearing his Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [Pacers Make Change to Home Court to Honor Reggie Miller](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-make-change-to-home-court-to-honor-reggie-miller)\\\\n\\\\nHeading into this season, there will be more spots open in the rotation than there have been in the last couple of years. It\\'s a rotation that still will be formidable, though.\\\\n\\\\n## Figuring out the Pacers\\' rotation without Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton\\\\n\\\\nWith Turner gone, the center spot is up in the air. Right now, Isaiah Jackson has the upper hand in winning the starting center spot. Unfortunately, he\\'s coming off a torn Achilles that he suffered early last season.\\\\n\\\\nIt will be a battle between Jackson and Jay Huff for the starting center minutes. James Wiseman will fight with whoever loses that battle for the backup center minutes. Tony Bradley is likely the odd man out.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [NBA Insider Predicts Tyrese Haliburton’s Olympic Future](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-news-nba-insider-predicts-tyrese-haliburtons-olympic-future)\\\\n\\\\nPascal Siakam and Aaron Nesmith will still be the other starters in the frontcourt. Obi Toppin is the backup power forward again, and he might see some small-ball center minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJarace Walker will likely finally get regular rotation minutes throughout the entire season. He fell out of the rotation in the playoffs, but he played well when he was given the opportunity to see the court.\\\\n\\\\n## The Pacers\\' backcourt has more questions than the frontcourt\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Nembhard slides over to the starting point guard position with Haliburton out. Bennedict Mathurin moves into the starting shooting guard position.\\\\n\\\\nT.J. McConnell is still the backup point guard, but the backup shooting guard spot is still up in the air. Ben Sheppard is the incumbent, but his poor offensive outings in the playoffs opened up the door for someone else to steal those minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJohnny Furphy has a chance to swoop in and take those minutes. It will be either Quenton Jackson or Kam Jones getting point guard minutes if Nembhard or McConnell gets in foul trouble.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pacers will still be a really good team this season. They should still make the playoffs, despite the rotational changes.\\\\n\\\\n## Latest Pacers News\\\\n\\\\n*For more news and notes on the Indiana Pacers, visit* [*Indiana Pacers on SI*](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers).\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[RYAN STANO](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/author/ry-stano)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n[Home](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers)/[News](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news)\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\nAAA\\\\n\\\\n## Privacy Preference Center\\\\n\\\\nWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.

From homeland security missions, to the grid, to our leading cloud service providers, to global banking transactions, every compliance gap can quickly become an operational catastrophe or worse, a national security risk,” said Travis Howerton, co-founder and CEO of RegScale.\\\\n\\\\n“RegScale was built to close those gaps in real time while cutting costs and accelerating missions,” Howerton added.\\\\n\\\\n**Related**: [Security Analytics Firm Vega Emerges From Stealth With $65M in Funding](https://www.securityweek.com/security-analytics-firm-vega-emerges-from-stealth-with-65m-in-funding/)\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement.

Normally, the funding would have arrived on October 1, but now, leaders at the state’s 27 public media stations, most of which are located in remote and isolated locales, had only a few weeks to find ways to fill the gap.\\\\n\\\\nStakeholders did what most civic leaders would do when confronted with a time-sensitive and hyper-local crisis —\\xa0they asked their local community foundation to fill the gap and support a coordinated statewide response. Within days, the Alaska Community Foundation (ACF) established the Voices Across Alaska Fund (VAA), a pooled fund that aims to keep every station on the air after October 1 and to develop a longer-term statewide sustainability plan.\\\\n\\\\nACF formally announced the fund [on August 1](https://alaskacf.org/alaska-launches-voices-across-alaska-fund-to-preserve-public-media/). Six weeks later, the Rasmuson Foundation, the largest private funder in Alaska, announced a $1.5 million grant to the VAA. “The fund is designed to do two things,” said President and CEO Gretchen Guess. “Keep stations on the air now and give leaders time to plan for a stronger, sustainable future without federal funding.” On September 14, *Anchorage Daily News*’Iris Samuels reported the fund had [raised $3.5 million](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/).\\\\n\\\\nVAA is drumming up support at a time when local media outlets are scrambling to fill CPB funding gaps with private dollars. Philanthropy is also taking the initiative. Most notably, last month, a group of funders, including the Knight, MacArthur and Ford foundations, committed [$36.5 million in emergency funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media) for at-risk public television and radio stations, focusing on outlets serving rural, Indigenous and other underserved communities.\\\\n\\\\nThe investment comports with these large and nationally focused funders’ long-standing support for [local media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media). But news out of Alaska is a reminder that mega foundations can’t do it alone. Building sustainable local media ecosystems also requires the involvement of community foundations that bring four distinct advantages to the table — deep ties with local outlets, discretionary grantmaking dollars, experience in quickly rolling out [pooled emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2020-6-30-community-foundation-leaders-talk-rapid-response-and-evolving-roles-during-crisis) and, as of 2023, collective oversight of at least [$54.9 billion](https://www.nptrust.org/reports/daf-report/) sitting in donor-advised funds that can fill federal funding gaps.\\\\n\\\\n“Voices Across Alaska emerged out of urgency, relationships, and trust,” said ACF President and CEO Alexandra McKay in an email to IP. “We had to act quickly so no Alaskan community lost its voice.”\\\\n\\\\n## How the Voices Across Alaska fund came together\\\\n\\\\nFounded in 1995, ACF has a long history of supporting Alaska’s [public media ecosystem](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media) through donor-advised and designated grants to stations, journalism initiatives and community storytelling projects. “Public media has always been one of the ways Alaskans care for each other — our donors have backed stations and storytelling for years, and ACF has often been the platform to make that support simple and effective,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nThe termination of CFB funding presented VAA’s advisors with a challenge that, I suspect, is also confronting stakeholders coordinating emergency response plans elsewhere: How to most effectively provide support for the state’s public media stations, especially when some have been independently raising money since first learning of the CPB cuts on July 17.\\\\n\\\\nAdvisors determined that the fund would adopt a two-step approach to governance and fund distribution to address this question.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, each station gets “credit” for the [emergency funds](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/a-regrantor-deploys-emergency-funding-as-others-wait-and-see-on-trump-cuts) it has raised locally since July 17, measured in months of operating runway. The pooled fund would then bring every station up to the same minimum coverage level, such as three months. If there’s still money available after that time frame, all stations are lifted together to the next milestone, such as six months, and then nine. This model, MacKay said, is “fair, simple and keeps every community’s station on air for the same amount of time.”\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation also approved of VAA’s approach. “It looks out for all the stations, from Unalaska to Utqiagvik to Ketchikan to Homer,” said Guess. “This grant is about meeting the moment with the long view in mind.”\\\\n\\\\nGuess’ perspective suggests that no fund can indefinitely operate on emergency footing, nor can its advisors plan on a future administration reinstituting terminated federal support. As a result, VAA advisors plan to have the state’s outlets pivot to opportunities that lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability once they achieve operational stability. These opportunities “could include [multi-year support](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/explainers/what-is-multiyear-funding), donor matching efforts, policy engagement and continued collaboration on shared services to reduce costs system-wide,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\n## Donor-advised fund support can stem the impacts of federal cuts\\\\n\\\\nRasmuson Foundation’s $1.5 million contribution to the VAA builds on its nearly $6 million in total funding for Alaska’s public broadcasting system since 1981. Previous grants helped to support the system’s infrastructure, statewide reporting collaborations and Indigenous programming such as [“Molly of Denali,”](https://pbskids.org/molly/) the first nationally distributed children’s show to feature an Alaska Native as the lead character.\\\\n\\\\nThe foundation joined a mix of individual donors, corporations and national funders that [have committed to the VAA](https://alaskacf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create/fund?funit_id=14239), with some choosing anonymity at this time. (ACF will share names once additional funders authorize public recognition.) “Having Rasmuson’s early support and promotion of Voices Across Alaska was both appreciated and reflected the trusted partnership we’ve built through past rapid-response efforts,” McKay said.\\\\n\\\\nFour words in McKay’s quote —\\xa0“past rapid-response efforts” —\\xa0speak to community foundations’ unique value proposition at a time when nonprofits are reeling from federal funding cuts\\xa0and bracing [for more reductions](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/02/us/trump-budget-2026) that will further increase demand for services. Community foundations are the first line of defense [whenever a crisis hits,](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2021-8-17-how-community-foundations-across-the-country-are-confronting-the-climate-crisis) which explains why Alaska’s public media leaders reached out to the ACF upon learning that CPB support had evaporated.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, community foundations have direct and indirect access to substantial financial resources. Together with its affiliate foundations, ACF supports donors and nonprofits, distributing over $15 million in grants annually. It also manages over $250 million in assets and administers more than 2,800 funds established by donors. It seems perfectly plausible that VAA can close the remaining gap in terminated federal funding with support from ACF’s [DAF account holders and other donors.](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-3-7-this-fund-is-using-daf-money-to-combat-inequities-in-venture-capital) Indeed, Alaska Public Media President Ed Ulman told *Anchorage Daily News*’ Samuels that since July, new donors [have begun giving](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/09/14/as-program-cuts-begin-in-wake-of-federal-rescission-alaska-fund-raises-35m-for-public-media/), or existing donors have upped their contributions.\\\\n\\\\nCommunity foundations are also using their bully pulpit to push back against cuts. In May, the *Orlando Sentinel* published an op-ed by Central Florida Foundation President and CEO Mark Brewer, titled [“Public Media is a Vital Community Asset.”](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/05/08/commentary-public-media-is-a-vital-community-asset/) “Cutting funding to public media is a profound mistake, with consequences far beyond the loss of popular programming,” Brewer wrote. “It erodes a crucial source of trusted information when the nation and our community struggle with disinformation and division.”\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, in the Twin Cities area, the Minneapolis Foundation will be convening national and local journalism thought leaders for the October 8 “[Minnesota Meeting: Next in News](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/events/minnesota-meeting-next-in-news/),” where they’ll sketch out a roadmap for a sustainable news ecosystem. Last month, the foundation committed $75,000 to Press Forward Minnesota, an affiliate of the [national journalism coalition](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/press-forward-director-dale-anglin-on-generating-funder-support-for-local-news), from its [OneMPLS Fund](https://www.minneapolisfoundation.org/onempls-fund/), a collective impact fund designed to respond to urgent and emerging local needs.\\\\n\\\\n“Local news fosters community connection, provides essential information and plays a critical role in our democracy by helping people engage in issues that affect their lives,” said Minneapolis Foundation Vice President of Collective Impact and Giving Patrice Relerford in an email to IP. “It’s important for all of us to work together to ensure that our news ecosystems continue to thrive.”\\\\n\\\\n**Related Inside Philanthropy Resources:**\\\\n\\\\n**For Subscribers Only**\\\\n\\\\n* [Journalism Grants](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/fundraising-for-journalism)\\\\n* [Report: Giving for Journalism and Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/state-of-american-philanthropy-pdfs/giving-for-journalism-and-public-media)\\\\n* [Civic & Democracy Grants for Nonprofits](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/find-a-grant/civic-democracy-grants)\\\\n\\\\n## Funders can be doing more to address federal funding cuts\\\\n\\\\nVAA may not be the largest Trump 2.0-era emergency response fund, nor does it cover [a broad swath of the United States](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/why-the-mellon-foundations-lifeline-for-humanities-councils-is-so-important).\\\\n\\\\nThat said, by providing an exportable roadmap for community foundations looking to help outlets serving remote and underserved areas, it’s a constructive addition to the national philanthropic dialogue. “Because rural stations operate with high fixed costs and extremely small revenue bases, they cannot quickly replace [lost federal funding](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-are-helping-grantees-withstand-federal-funding-cuts),” McKay said. “If a station goes dark, it is costly — and sometimes impossible — to bring it back.”\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, community foundations already have the muscle memory for rolling out emergency funding. VAA’s governance model builds on this core competency by showing how funding can equitably stabilize a state’s stations before pivoting to activities that ensure the field’s long-term financial sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nThe VAA is also a reminder that the ongoing debate as to whether philanthropy can [“fill the gaps”](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/actually-philanthropy-can-fill-the-gaps-or-at-least-think-much-bigger) in terminated federal funding isn’t a zero-sum proposition.\\\\n\\\\nNo one, to my knowledge, is asking funders sitting on a combined $1.93 trillion —\\xa0that’s [$1.68 trillion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2024-1-29-foundation-assets-reach-a-record) currently sitting in private foundation coffers and [$254 billion](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/three-takeaways-from-a-new-report-providing-a-penetrating-look-at-the-daf-industry) in DAF accounts as of 2023 — to cover [$425 billion](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-trump-continues-block-least-425-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american) in congressionally authorized funding that’s been frozen by the Trump administration. But saying funders can only do so much takes a page from the [scarcity mindset](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2022-8-3-philanthropys-scarcity-mindset-is-hurting-the-sector-not-helping-it) that has unfortunately pervaded the philanthropshere for years, when in reality, the sector has formidable resources to mitigate the impacts of federal cuts.\\\\n\\\\nPhilanthropy’s collective resources — financial and otherwise —\\xa0are bountiful, and community foundations can help build resilient local news ecosystems by acting as a trusted convening partner, allocating discretionary grantmaking dollars and encouraging their DAF holders to support organizations through pooled funds like VAA.\\\\n\\\\n“Alaskans look out for each other,” said ACF’s McKay. “Voices Across Alaska is how we stay connected — working together so every community’s voice continues to be heard.”\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## **Featured**\\\\n\\\\n* ## [How Community Foundations Can Help Local Public Media Withstand Federal Funding Cuts](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/how-community-foundations-can-help-local-public-media-withstand-federal-funding-cuts)\\\\n* ## [Will Philanthropy Get a Cut of the $3.3 Billion Murdoch Succession Deal?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/will-philanthropy-get-a-cut-of-the-3-3-billion-murdoch-succession-deal)\\\\n* ## [Rapid Response: Funders Pool Their Dollars to Protect Public Media](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/rapid-response-funders-pool-their-dollars-to-protect-public-media)\\\\n* ## [Spreading Love Through Media, the Regrantor Way](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/spreading-love-through-media-the-regrantor-way)\\\\n* ## [After a Hiatus, What’s New with Open Society Foundations’ Distinctive Fellowships?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/after-a-hiatus-whats-new-with-open-society-foundations-distinctive-fellowships)\\\\n* ## [Who’s Funding Public News Media?](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/whos-funding-public-news-media)\\\\n* ## [What Wallis Annenberg’s Passing Could Mean for L.A.’s Legendary Family Foundation](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/what-wallis-annenbergs-passing-could-mean-for-l-a-s-legendary-family-foundation)\\\\n* ## [What Happens When the Feds Target a Nonprofit?

Oklahoma City was the deepest team in the league and it showed on the brightest stage. Mark Daigneault never wavered from his strategy of playing a deep bench and the effort and energy outlasted other elite teams in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThe bench played a key role in the Thunder’s title run, there’s no doubt about it. But the Thunder also had one of the best — if not the best — starting lineups in the NBA. Oklahoma City’s starting lineup logged an unbelievable plus-14.8 when sharing the floor together. It didn’t matter if Oklahoma City went big with **Isaiah Hartenstein** or small with **Cason Wallace** — it was sheer domination.\\\\n\\\\nAs the Thunder turns its attention to a quest for going back-to-back, there will be a lot of familiar faces up and down the rotation. The starting five should remain unchanged, and the team’s entire lineup is back for another year. The chemistry will only continue to grow.\\\\n\\\\nAs Oklahoma City’s starting lineup was the NBA’s best a season ago, there’s no reason to expect that will change this upcoming season. [Bleacher Report recently graded each team’s starting lineup](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason) after the offseason, and it’s no surprise that the Thunder’s was in the top group.\\\\n\\\\n“OKC\\'s title-winning team is fully intact and should have plenty of trust in the above unit, which offers a double-big look without sacrificing spacing or secondary facilitation,” [Grant Hughes wrote](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25242479-grading-every-nba-teams-starting-lineup-after-offseason). “If anything, (Chet) Holmgren should be expected to improve his shooting, and Hartenstein could easily make further developments as a foul-line passing hub.\\\\n\\\\n“(Lu) Dort and J-Dub are as good as it gets defensively on the wing, and Holmgren is arguably more impactful than either of them as a highly mobile shot-blocker. With SGA running an offense that should be focused on improving its flow, there\\'s no reason to expect these guys to be anything less than the best lineup in the league.”\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City received the highest grade given out at an A, as there were no A+ grades given out across the league. Joining the Thunder at A-status was the New York Knicks, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Houston Rockets. Of course, three of those teams are Western Conference foes, and the Thunder faced off against two of them in the postseason.\\\\n\\\\nThis Thunder team getting even better with another year of chemistry, development, and continuity should be a terrifying thought for the rest of the NBA — but it’s entirely possible. By the time the bench unit comes in, the comfortable lead allows the rest of the rotation to play a free flowing style of basketball and maintain the pace on both ends of the floor.\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma City’s starting lineup should only improve with more court time and motivation to back to back.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nPublished\\\\n\\\\n[ROSS LOVELACE](https://www.si.com/nba/thunder/author/ross-lovelace)\\\\n\\\\nRoss is a 2023 Oklahoma University graduate who has formerly written for the OU Daily and Prep Hoops.

The company aims to enhance geothermal efficiency by using a closed-loop system filled with refrigerant, unlike traditional water-based systems. This approach is expected to be 50% more efficient and reduce water usage. Leading the Series A round are Evok Innovations and other notable investors such as Active Impact Investments and Toyota Ventures. Despite facing competition from established companies like Fervo Energy and XGS Energy, Rodatherm plans to utilize the funding to build a 1.8-megawatt pilot plant in Utah by 2026, with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems set to purchase electricity from the project.\\\\n\\\\n#### Tags:\\\\n\\\\n[closed-loop system](https://www.startupecosystem.ca/news/tag/closed-loop-system/)[Energy

The Wildcats finished second only behind Texas Tech, which made the National Championship Series and came within a game of winning the title.\\\\n\\\\nLeading the way for Arizona was dual threat player Devyn Netz, who posted an ERA of 2.25 (career-high)\\xa0 winning 22 games in 152 ⅓ innings of work to go along with her 118 strikeouts.\\\\n\\\\nNov 28, 2014; Tucson, AZ, USA; Detailed view of an Arizona State Sun Devils sticker over the logo of the Arizona Wildcats during the 88th annual territorial cup at Arizona Stadium.

She was a monster at the plate, batting .347 in 173 at-bats and smacking 19 home runs while driving in 68 RBI on the year.\\\\n\\\\nWith the ability to pitch in the circle and get it done at the plate, Netz won the Big 12 Player of the Year Award and was named to the NFCA second-team All-American list.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the Wildcats were able to make the postseason and host a regional as the No. 13 overall seed hosting Ole Miss, Grand Canyon and Santa Clara, the Wildcats were unable to get out of their own regional.\\\\n\\\\nThen, at the end of the season, Arizona and Lowe saw a mass exodus of players enter the transfer portal and leave the program, including most of its pitching staff and star outfielder Dakota Kennedy, joining other teams.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the Wildcats and coach Lowe are trying to get things back on track and are working towards building up the 2027 recruiting class.\\\\n\\\\nRecently, the Wildcats were able to land a four-star recruit in catcher Emma Anderson, who is out of Eaton, Colo. and is listed as the No. 1 player in the state.\\\\n\\\\n“I’m so excited to announce my commitment to the University of Arizona to further my academic and athletic career!

He has been a mainstay for the last decade, and he decided to leave this offseason for Milwaukee.\\\\n\\\\nTurner won\\'t be the only player who is gone from the lineup. Tyrese Haliburton will miss the entire season after tearing his Achilles tendon during Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [Pacers Make Change to Home Court to Honor Reggie Miller](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-make-change-to-home-court-to-honor-reggie-miller)\\\\n\\\\nHeading into this season, there will be more spots open in the rotation than there have been in the last couple of years. It\\'s a rotation that still will be formidable, though.\\\\n\\\\n## Figuring out the Pacers\\' rotation without Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton\\\\n\\\\nWith Turner gone, the center spot is up in the air. Right now, Isaiah Jackson has the upper hand in winning the starting center spot. Unfortunately, he\\'s coming off a torn Achilles that he suffered early last season.\\\\n\\\\nIt will be a battle between Jackson and Jay Huff for the starting center minutes. James Wiseman will fight with whoever loses that battle for the backup center minutes. Tony Bradley is likely the odd man out.\\\\n\\\\n**More news:** [NBA Insider Predicts Tyrese Haliburton’s Olympic Future](https://www.si.com/nba/pacers/news/pacers-news-nba-insider-predicts-tyrese-haliburtons-olympic-future)\\\\n\\\\nPascal Siakam and Aaron Nesmith will still be the other starters in the frontcourt. Obi Toppin is the backup power forward again, and he might see some small-ball center minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJarace Walker will likely finally get regular rotation minutes throughout the entire season. He fell out of the rotation in the playoffs, but he played well when he was given the opportunity to see the court.\\\\n\\\\n## The Pacers\\' backcourt has more questions than the frontcourt\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Nembhard slides over to the starting point guard position with Haliburton out. Bennedict Mathurin moves into the starting shooting guard position.\\\\n\\\\nT.J. McConnell is still the backup point guard, but the backup shooting guard spot is still up in the air. Ben Sheppard is the incumbent, but his poor offensive outings in the playoffs opened up the door for someone else to steal those minutes.\\\\n\\\\nJohnny Furphy has a chance to swoop in and take those minutes. It will be either Quenton Jackson or Kam Jones getting point guard minutes if Nembhard or McConnell gets in foul trouble.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pacers will still be a really good team this season.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool.

This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \\n- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. \\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file.

When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\\n[\\'- critique-agent: Used to critique the final report. Give this agent some information about how you want it to critique the report.\\', \\'- research-agent: Used to research more in depth questions. Only give this researcher one topic at a time. Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3.

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do.

Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right.

Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

Suggest improvements if needed.\", \"subagent_type\": \"critique-agent\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Here is a detailed critique of the final report on Agentech in Oklahoma City, focusing on depth, accuracy, structure, and citation quality, along with suggestions for improvement:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow. Addressing these areas will make it a more comprehensive and authoritative resource on Agentech in Oklahoma City.', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Rs9WolBzJVY3Rq4XEGho6Nlj'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.\\n\\nThe first thing you should do is to write the original user question to `question.txt` so you have a record of it.\\n\\nUse the research-agent to conduct deep research. It will respond to your questions/topics with a detailed answer.\\n\\nWhen you think you enough information to write a final report, write it to `final_report.md`\\n\\nYou can call the critique-agent to get a critique of the final report. After that (if needed) you can do more research and edit the `final_report.md`\\nYou can do this however many times you want until are you satisfied with the result.\\n\\nOnly edit the file once at a time (if you call this tool in parallel, there may be conflicts).\\n\\nHere are instructions for writing the final report:\\n\\n<report_instructions>\\n\\nCRITICAL: Make sure the answer is written in the same language as the human messages! If you make a todo plan - you should note in the plan what language the report should be in so you dont forget!\\nNote: the language the report should be in is the language the QUESTION is in, not the language/country that the question is ABOUT.\\n\\nPlease create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:\\n1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)\\n2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research\\n3. References relevant sources using [Title](URL) format\\n4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.\\n5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\\n\\nYou can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ intro\\n2/ overview of topic A\\n3/ overview of topic B\\n4/ comparison between A and B\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\\n1/ list of things or table of things\\nOr, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don\\'t need an introduction or conclusion.\\n1/ item 1\\n2/ item 2\\n3/ item 3\\n\\nTo answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\\n1/ overview of topic\\n2/ concept 1\\n3/ concept 2\\n4/ concept 3\\n5/ conclusion\\n\\nIf you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!\\n1/ answer\\n\\nREMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\\nMake sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\\n\\nFor each section of the report, do the following:\\n- Use simple, clear language\\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\\n- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \\n- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\\n- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\\n- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\\n\\nREMEMBER:\\nThe brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.\\nMake sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.\\n\\nFormat the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.\\n\\n<Citation Rules>\\n- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text\\n- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers\\n- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose\\n- Each source should be a separate line item in a list, so that in markdown it is rendered as a list.\\n- Example format:\\n  [1] Source Title: URL\\n  [2] Source Title: URL\\n- Citations are extremely important. Make sure to include these, and pay a lot of attention to getting these right. Users will often use these citations to look into more information.\\n</Citation Rules>\\n</report_instructions>\\n\\nYou have access to a few tools.\\n\\n## `internet_search`\\n\\nUse this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.\\nYou have access to a number of standard tools\\n\\n## `write_todos`\\n\\nYou have access to the `write_todos` tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task.

Suggest improvements if needed.\", \"subagent_type\": \"critique-agent\"}'}}]}, {'content': 'Here is a detailed critique of the final report on Agentech in Oklahoma City, focusing on depth, accuracy, structure, and citation quality, along with suggestions for improvement:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow. Addressing these areas will make it a more comprehensive and authoritative resource on Agentech in Oklahoma City.', 'role': 'tool', 'tool_call_id': 'call_Rs9WolBzJVY3Rq4XEGho6Nlj'}], 'model': 'gpt-4.1', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_todos', 'description': 'Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\\n\\n## When to Use This Tool\\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\\n\\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\\n\\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\\n\\nSkip using this tool when:\\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\\n\\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\\n\\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you\\'re done!\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for our new product launch, including social media, email marketing, and press releases.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you plan a comprehensive marketing campaign for your product launch. Let me create a todo list to organize all the components.\\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\\n1. Define target audience and key messaging\\n2. Create social media content calendar and posting schedule\\n3. Design email marketing sequence and automation flows\\n4. Draft press release and identify media contacts\\n5. Set up tracking and analytics for campaign performance\\n6. Create visual assets and brand materials\\n7. Coordinate launch timeline and deliverables\\n*Begins working on the first task*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. Marketing campaign planning involves multiple distinct channels and activities\\n2. Each component requires careful coordination and planning\\n3. The systematic approach ensures all aspects of the launch are covered\\n4. Progress tracking helps maintain timeline and deliverables\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of \\'getCwd\\'.\\n*Uses search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\\nAssistant: I\\'ve found 15 instances of \\'getCwd\\' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains consistency\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: I need help organizing my home office: decluttering the desk, setting up a filing system, organizing digital files, and creating a daily workflow.\\nAssistant: I\\'ll help you organize your home office systematically. Let me create a todo list to track each area of organization.\\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Sort and declutter desk items, 2) Set up physical filing system for documents, 3) Organize digital files and folders, 4) Create daily workflow and productivity systems, 5) Establish maintenance routines*\\nLet\\'s start with decluttering your desk space to create a clean foundation for the other organizational systems.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\\n1. The user provided multiple distinct organizational tasks\\n2. Each area requires different approaches and careful planning\\n3. Home organization benefits from systematic, step-by-step completion\\n4. Progress tracking ensures all areas are addressed thoroughly\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: How do I print \\'Hello World\\' in Python?\\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\\n\\npython\\nprint(\"Hello World\")\\n\\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There\\'s no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What\\'s the best way to water houseplants?\\nAssistant: The best way to water houseplants depends on the specific plant type, but here are some general guidelines:\\n\\n- Check soil moisture by inserting your finger about 1-2 inches into the soil\\n- Water thoroughly when the top inch feels dry, allowing water to drain from the bottom\\n- Use room temperature water and water in the morning when possible\\n- Avoid overwatering, which is more harmful than underwatering for most plants\\n\\nDifferent plants have different needs, so it\\'s important to research your specific varieties for optimal care.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual tasks to complete. The user is simply asking for advice and explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or activities.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location. Adding a comment doesn\\'t require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nUser: What time is it in Tokyo right now?\\nAssistant: I\\'ll check the current time in Tokyo for you.\\n\\n*Searches for current time in Tokyo*\\n\\nThe current time in Tokyo, Japan is [current time]. Tokyo is in the Japan Standard Time (JST) zone, which is UTC+9.\\n\\n<reasoning>\\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single information lookup with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward request.\\n</reasoning>\\n</example>\\n\\n## Task States and Management\\n\\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\\n   - pending: Task not yet started\\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\\n\\n2. **Task Management**:\\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don\\'t batch completions)\\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\\n     - There are unresolved issues or errors\\n     - Work is partial or incomplete\\n     - You encountered blockers that prevent completion\\n     - You couldn\\'t find necessary resources or dependencies\\n     - Quality standards haven\\'t been met\\n\\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\\n   - Create specific, actionable items\\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\\n\\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'todos': {'items': {'description': 'Todo to track.', 'properties': {'content': {'type': 'string'}, 'status': {'enum': ['pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'], 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['content', 'status'], 'type': 'object'}, 'type': 'array'}}, 'required': ['todos'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'write_file', 'description': 'Write to a file.', 'parameters': {'properties': {'file_path': {'type': 'string'}, 'content': {'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['file_path', 'content'], 'type': 'object'}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'read_file', 'description': \"Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Do not pass multiple sub questions to this researcher. Instead, you should break down a large topic into the necessary components, and then call multiple research agents in parallel, one for each sub question.\\']\\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\\n\\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\\n- When you are instructed to execute custom slash commands. Use the Agent tool with the slash command invocation as the entire prompt. The slash command can take arguments. For example: Task(description=\"Check the file\", prompt=\"/check-file path/to/file.py\")\\n\\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for a specific term or definition within a known location, use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\\n- If you are searching for content within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\\n\\n\\nUsage notes:\\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\\n4. The agent\\'s outputs should generally be trusted\\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to create content, perform analysis, or just do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user\\'s intent\\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\\n\\nExample usage:\\n\\n<example_agent_descriptions>\\n\"content-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done creating significant content or documents\\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\\n\"research-analyst\": use this agent to conduct thorough research on complex topics\\n</example_agent_description>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\\nassistant: I\\'m going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\\n<code>\\nfunction isPrime(n) {\\n  if (n <= 1) return false\\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\\n  }\\n  return true\\n}\\n</code>\\n<commentary>\\nSince significant content was created and the task was completed, now use the content-reviewer agent to review the work\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: Now let me use the content-reviewer agent to review the code\\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch with the content-reviewer agent \\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nuser: \"Can you help me research the environmental impact of different renewable energy sources and create a comprehensive report?\"\\n<commentary>\\nThis is a complex research task that would benefit from using the research-analyst agent to conduct thorough analysis\\n</commentary>\\nassistant: I\\'ll help you research the environmental impact of renewable energy sources.

The company’s mission is to revolutionize the claims process by deploying “Agentic AI Agents”—hundreds of specialized digital agents that work alongside human adjusters to streamline and accelerate claims handling.\\n\\nFounding and Key People:\\nAgentech was co-founded by Robin Roberson and Alex Pezold. Both founders have significant backgrounds in insurtech and cybersecurity, with notable entrepreneurial experience and successful exits in their previous ventures. Alex Pezold, for example, previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company, and led it to one of the largest technology exits in Oklahoma in 2022. Robin Roberson is also recognized as a prominent figure in the Oklahoma City tech and insurance sectors.\\n\\nFunding:\\nIn its early stages, Agentech raised $3 million to support its growth and expansion efforts. This funding round was aimed at scaling operations, further developing its AI technology, and expanding its reach within the insurance industry. The company’s funding and valuation details are also tracked on platforms like PitchBook and Crunchbase, though specific investor names have not been widely publicized as of mid-2024.\\n\\nDevelopment Milestones:\\n- 2023: Agentech was founded and began developing its core AI claims automation platform.\\n- 2023-2024: The company focused on transforming the pet insurance claims space, successfully demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of its digital agents.\\n- 2024: Agentech expanded its technology to support property and casualty (P&C) claims processing, with plans to enter additional markets such as travel, workers’ compensation, gadget, renters, and home warranty claims.\\n- The company has established partnerships with select insurance carriers and third-party administrators (TPAs) as design partners, integrating its AI solutions into real-world claims workflows.\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as sorting through medical records, handwritten notes, and scattered documents, allowing human adjusters to focus on decision-making and customer service. The company claims that its solutions can increase claim processing output by over four times without increasing labor costs, while also reducing manual errors and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nReferences:\\n1.

Depth\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report provides a solid overview of Agentech, including its founding, leadership, funding, and mission.\\n- It covers the company’s products and services in reasonable detail, highlighting the use of AI-powered digital agents and their application in insurance claims.\\n- The impact on the local tech ecosystem, partnerships, and industry recognition are discussed.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Market Context:** The report could benefit from a deeper analysis of the broader insurtech and AI landscape in Oklahoma City and nationally. How does Agentech compare to competitors? What is the size and growth rate of the market they operate in?\\n- **Technical Depth:** While the report mentions “over 200 AI-powered digital agents,” it does not explain the underlying technology, unique algorithms, or proprietary advantages. More detail on what differentiates Agentech’s AI from standard automation would add value.\\n- **Customer Impact:** There is little discussion of customer adoption, case studies, or testimonials. Including real-world examples or metrics (e.g., claims processed, time saved, error reduction) would strengthen the analysis.\\n- **Challenges and Risks:** The report is overwhelmingly positive. A balanced analysis should mention potential challenges, such as regulatory hurdles, data privacy concerns, or competition from larger insurtech firms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Accuracy\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report appears factually accurate, with specific details about founders, funding, partnerships, and awards.\\n- Dates and figures (e.g., $3 million funding, 2023 founding) are provided and sourced.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Verification of Claims:** Some statements, such as being a “leader in agentic AI” or “widely regarded as a pioneer,” are subjective and should be supported by third-party validation or industry rankings.\\n- **Recent Developments:** The report states there have been “no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events.” This should be double-checked for accuracy, as the tech sector evolves rapidly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Structure\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report follows a logical structure: Overview, Background and History, Products/Services, Impact, Recent News, Conclusion, and Sources.\\n- Section headings are clear and appropriate.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **Section Depth:** Some sections, such as “Recent News and Developments,” are quite brief. If there is little news, consider combining this with the Impact section or expanding it with industry context.\\n- **Transitions:** The report could use smoother transitions between sections to improve flow. For example, linking the company’s history to its current impact, or connecting product features to customer outcomes.\\n- **Conclusion:** The conclusion is concise but could be more analytical, summarizing key findings and offering a forward-looking perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Citation Quality\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- The report includes a comprehensive list of sources, with URLs for verification.\\n- Citations are placed at the end of relevant paragraphs or sentences.\\n\\n**Areas for Improvement:**\\n- **In-Text Citations:** The use of bracketed numbers ([1], [2], etc.) is good, but some paragraphs contain multiple claims with a single citation at the end. It would be clearer to cite each specific claim or fact.\\n- **Source Diversity:** Most sources are company websites, press releases, or local news. Including more independent or analytical sources (e.g., industry reports, academic articles) would enhance credibility.\\n- **Citation Placement:** Ensure that every factual or evaluative statement is directly supported by a citation, especially for subjective or superlative claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n1. **Expand Market and Technical Analysis:** Add sections or paragraphs on the competitive landscape, market trends, and technical differentiators.\\n2. **Include Customer and Industry Impact:** Provide data, case studies, or testimonials to illustrate Agentech’s real-world impact.\\n3. **Balance the Narrative:** Address potential risks, challenges, or criticisms to provide a more nuanced view.\\n4. **Enhance Citations:** Use more diverse and independent sources, and ensure precise citation placement for all key facts.\\n5. **Improve Flow and Transitions:** Add linking sentences between sections and ensure each section builds on the previous one.\\n6. **Deepen the Conclusion:** Summarize the main insights and offer predictions or recommendations for Agentech’s future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**  \\nThe report is well-structured, accurate, and informative, but would benefit from greater depth, more balanced analysis, richer citations, and improved narrative flow.

Roberson is a recognized figure in Oklahoma City’s tech and insurance sectors, while Pezold previously founded TokenEx, a cybersecurity company that achieved one of Oklahoma’s largest technology exits in 2022. Agentech was launched with a $3 million funding round, raised in just 30 days from Oklahoma investors, including Oklahoma City-based Cortado Ventures. The company’s early focus was on transforming pet insurance claims, and it has since expanded to property and casualty (P&C) claims and other insurance verticals.[1][2][3][4]\\n\\n## Products, Services, and Areas of Expertise\\nAgentech’s core offering is a suite of over 200 AI-powered digital agents designed to automate and optimize insurance claims workflows. Key features and services include:\\n\\n- **AI-Powered Digital Agents:** Automate repetitive tasks such as document review, data extraction, fraud flagging, compliance checks, and triage, allowing human adjusters to focus on complex decision-making.\\n- **Hybrid AI Solutions:** Combine out-of-the-box efficiency with deep customization for carrier-specific workflows, enabling rapid deployment and tailored solutions.[5]\\n- **Automated Claims Adjudication:** Provide AI-driven insights, summaries, and issue flagging to streamline the adjudication process.\\n- **Specialized Solutions:** Tailored offerings for specific insurance lines, such as pet insurance, where AI organizes veterinary records into decision-ready profiles.\\n- **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing claims management systems, including partnerships with platforms like Snapsheet.[6]\\n\\nAgentech’s technology is designed to work alongside human adjusters, not replace them, and can operate 24/7 to keep claims moving efficiently. The company’s solutions are scalable, customizable, and focused on improving productivity, reducing manual errors, and enhancing customer experiences.\\n\\n## Impact, Reputation, and Presence in Oklahoma City\\nAgentech has had a notable impact on Oklahoma City’s tech ecosystem:\\n\\n- **Tech Ecosystem Influence:** Agentech’s rapid growth and innovative technology have contributed to Oklahoma City’s reputation as a hub for AI and insurtech innovation. The company’s success aligns with the region’s expanding tech investment and infrastructure.[7]\\n- **Employment:** Agentech employs between 11 and 50 people, with growth expected as the company expands into new insurance verticals. Its digital workforce model also enables local insurance carriers and TPAs to scale operations efficiently.\\n- **Partnerships:** Strategic collaborations with Snapsheet, AmerAdjust, and Cortado Ventures have amplified Agentech’s capabilities and fostered a culture of innovation in the local tech community.[6][8][9]\\n- **Industry Recognition:** Agentech was a finalist for Technology Solution of the Year at the 2025 Captive Awards and has been featured in industry publications for its pioneering work in claims automation.[10]\\n- **Reputation:** The company is widely regarded as a pioneer in agentic AI for insurance, with a strong leadership team and a reputation for delivering tangible efficiency gains and improved customer experiences.\\n\\n## Recent News and Developments\\nAs of mid-2024, Agentech’s most notable developments include its initial $3 million funding round, strategic partnerships, and industry award nominations. There have been no major public reports of additional funding, product launches, or other significant events beyond these milestones. The company continues to be recognized for its innovation and contributions to the insurance technology sector.[1][2][10]\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAgentech stands out as a rapidly growing, innovative company in Oklahoma City’s tech landscape. With a focus on AI-driven claims automation, experienced leadership, and strong local investment, Agentech is poised to expand its influence both within Oklahoma and across the broader insurance industry. Its partnerships, industry recognition, and commitment to augmenting human talent with advanced AI solutions position it as a key player in the future of insurance technology.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Agentech creates digital workforce for AI insurance claims workflow: https://journalrecord.com/2025/03/20/agentech-creates-digital-workforce-for-ai-insurance-claims-workflow/\\n[2] Agentech - Crunchbase Company Profile & Funding: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blink-inc-06b6\\n[3] Agentech - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentech-com\\n[4] Agentech | AI-Powered Claims Automation for Insurance: https://www.agentech.com/\\n[5] Agentech Hybrid AI Solution: https://www.agentech.com/resources/articles/a-hybrid-ai-solution-for-claims-automation-how-agentech-combines-out-of-the-box-efficiency-with-custom-qa-precision\\n[6] Snapsheet and Agentech Partnership: https://www.snapsheetclaims.com/snapsheet-and-agentech-partner-to-revolutionize-claims-processing-with-ai-driven-digital-agents/\\n[7] Nucamp Tech News: Oklahoma City Tech Sector: https://www.nucamp.co/blog/this-months-latest-tech-news-in-oklahoma-city-ok--saturday-may-31st-2025-edition\\n[8] Coverager: AmerAdjust Leverages Agentech: https://coverager.com/ameradjust-leverages-agentechs-digital-claims-co-workers/\\n[9] Cortado Ventures: Why We Invested: Agentech: https://cortado.ventures/why-we-invested-agentech/\\n[10] Agentech News: Finalist for Technology Solution of the Year: https://www.agentech.com/resources/articles/agentech-finalist-for-technology-solution-of-the-year\\n'}}"

Inside, it’s like stepping back into a 1960s dining room — in a good way. The menu leans toward comfort food like pork chops and meatloaf, but they do it well. Cocktails are classic (no overcomplicated $17 drinks here), and the prices are reasonable. You don’t need a reservation, but it helps during peak hours. It’s a relaxed date night spot that works if you’re tired of places trying too hard. [...] Flycatcher is a bar that doesn’t feel like it’s trying too hard. Live music, thoughtful cocktails, and a smashed double cheeseburger that Alton Brown called the best in the country. That alone would make it worth a stop. It’s dark, moody, and loud in a way that still works for a date night. You can hang at the bar or post up in the corner and people-watch. It feels current without being pretentious. They do ticketed events too, so check the calendar if you want to time your visit. [...] For a daytime date or a low-effort meetup, Clarity Coffee is one of the better cafes in OKC. The space is clean and minimalist, the coffee’s good, and it’s located downtown near several walkable stops. Their rotating roaster list includes some hard-to-find beans if you’re into specialty coffee. There’s no food (beyond a tiny case of fresh pastries), but nearby bakeries or restaurants fill the gap.
